With a body unlike any before hers, she mesmerized viewers and choreographers alike - her elongated, race-horse physique became the new prototype for the great George Balanchine. Her unique style, humor and authenticity redefined ballet for all dancers who followed. Amazingly, she was the muse to not one great artist but two; both George Balanchine and Jerome Robbins loved her as a dancer and a woman. Balanchine married her and Robbins created his famous version of Afternoon of a Faun for Tanny. Tanaquil Le Clercq was the foremost dancer of her day until it suddenly all stopped. On a tour of Europe, she was struck down by polio and paralyzed. She never danced again.", "tokens": ["of", "great", "ballerina", "tanaquil", "le", "clercq", "mai", "transcend", "with", "bodi", "unlik", "mesmer", "viewer", "choreograph", "alik", "elong", "race", "hors", "physiqu", "becam", "new", "prototyp", "great", "georg", "balanchin", "her", "uniqu", "style", "humor", "authent", "redefin", "ballet", "dancer", "follow", "amazingli", "muse", "on", "great", "artist", "two", "georg", "balanchin", "jerom", "robbin", "love", "dancer", "woman", "balanchin", "marri", "robbin", "creat", "famou", "version", "afternoon", "faun", "tanni", "tanaquil", "le", "clercq", "foremost", "dancer", "dai", "suddenli", "stop", "on", "tour", "europ", "struck", "polio", "paralyz", "she", "never", "danc"], "tmdb_score_value": 6.0, "tmdb_score_count": 2, "imdb_score_value": 7.3, "imdb_score_count": 171, "meta_score_value": 76.0, "meta_score_count": 13}
