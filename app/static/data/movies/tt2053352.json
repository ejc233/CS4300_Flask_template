This film guides you through this fashion pioneer's long career from her youth in Paris until she became a leading magazine fashion columnist and editor. In this medium, Vreeland challenged its preconceptions to present a new definition of beauty and vivaciousness where nice clothes were just the beginning for something deeper. Even when that vocation ended, Vreeland managed to gain a new museum profession to present clothing's history in her own inimitable way.", "tokens": ["for", "decad", "diana", "vreeland", "on", "lead", "author", "fashion", "eccentr", "self", "taught", "skill", "bold", "stylist", "audac", "thi", "film", "guid", "fashion", "pioneer", "long", "career", "youth", "pari", "becam", "lead", "magazin", "fashion", "columnist", "editor", "in", "medium", "vreeland", "challeng", "preconcept", "present", "new", "definit", "beauti", "vivaci", "nice", "cloth", "begin", "someth", "deeper", "even", "vocat", "end", "vreeland", "manag", "gain", "new", "museum", "profess", "present", "cloth", "histori", "inimit", "wai"], "tmdb_score_value": 7.1, "tmdb_score_count": 17, "imdb_score_value": 7.5, "imdb_score_count": 1211, "meta_score_value": 69.0, "meta_score_count": 21}
