This is the first time ever that a film maker has access to Ingmar Bergman in his home at the small island F\u00e5r\u00f6 in the Baltic Sea. Bergman and the Cinema starts with Frenzy from 1944 and ends with Saraband from 2003. It contains unique behind-the-scenes material from Bergman's private archive. Bergman and the Theatre is about some of Bergman's 125 theatrical stagings and about his delight with the TV medium with successes as Scenes from a marriage. In Bergman and F\u00e5r\u00f6 Island he talks about the childhood that shaped him. He shows where he shot his film Persona and fell in love - and he lists his worst demons!", "tokens": ["all", "three", "documentari", "mainli", "shot", "home", "ingmar", "bergman", "thi", "first", "time", "ever", "film", "maker", "access", "ingmar", "bergman", "home", "small", "island", "f\u00e5r\u00f6", "baltic", "sea", "bergman", "cinema", "start", "frenzi", "1944", "end", "saraband", "2003", "it", "contain", "uniqu", "behind", "scene", "materi", "bergman", "privat", "archiv", "bergman", "theatr", "bergman", "125", "theatric", "stage", "delight", "tv", "medium", "success", "scene", "marriag", "in", "bergman", "f\u00e5r\u00f6", "island", "talk", "childhood", "shape", "he", "show", "shot", "film", "persona", "fell", "love", "list", "worst", "demon"], "tmdb_score_value": 7.0, "tmdb_score_count": 4, "imdb_score_value": 7.9, "imdb_score_count": 705, "meta_score_value": 71.0, "meta_score_count": 5}
