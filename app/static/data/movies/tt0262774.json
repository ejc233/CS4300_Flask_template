He's working on a documentary, for Japanese TV, on Iranian burial practices. On the anniversary of his wife's death, a hitchhiker tells him a story of spousal abuse and infant mortality, he discovers that someone has been buried in his plot next to his wife, and he needs the help of his attorney, a well-connected fixer. He dreams of death, even as he investigates it for his film. His niece's husband, a well-known writer, fails to return home; he searches hospitals for an unclaimed body. His heart disease is flaring up. Is he prepared for death? Is that all that's left?", "tokens": ["death", "surround", "bahman", "director", "made", "film", "24", "year", "get", "past", "censor", "he", "work", "documentari", "japanes", "tv", "iranian", "burial", "practic", "on", "anniversari", "wife", "death", "hitchhik", "tell", "stori", "spousal", "abus", "infant", "mortal", "discov", "someon", "buri", "plot", "next", "wife", "need", "help", "attornei", "well", "connect", "fixer", "he", "dream", "death", "even", "investig", "film", "hi", "niec", "husband", "well", "known", "writer", "fail", "return", "home", "search", "hospit", "unclaim", "bodi", "hi", "heart", "diseas", "flare", "is", "prepar", "death", "is", "left"], "tmdb_score_value": 5.0, "tmdb_score_count": 1, "imdb_score_value": 6.8, "imdb_score_count": 567, "meta_score_value": 63.0, "meta_score_count": 19}
