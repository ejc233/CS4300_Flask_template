Taro, an old man who dies homeless in Tokyo has told Yosuke, a weak-willed out-of-work salaryman about a golden statue that he left years ago in a house by the sea in Noto. Yosuke goes and he's captivated by Saeko, a young women who lives in the house where Taro left the statue. She has a strange affliction: water builds up in her and she can only vent it by wicked acts, such as shoplifting, or, more powerfully, through orgasm. Yosuke obliges, the water gives him life, as well as the plants and fish it reaches. Saeko feels shame, and she has a past. Taro's ghost urges Yosuke to fulfill his desires, but can the relationship survive?", "tokens": ["an", "imposs", "tale", "taro", "old", "man", "di", "homeless", "tokyo", "told", "yosuk", "weak", "will", "work", "salaryman", "golden", "statu", "left", "year", "ago", "hous", "sea", "noto", "yosuk", "goe", "captiv", "saeko", "young", "women", "live", "hous", "taro", "left", "statu", "she", "strang", "afflict", "water", "build", "vent", "wick", "act", "shoplift", "powerfulli", "orgasm", "yosuk", "oblig", "water", "give", "life", "well", "plant", "fish", "reach", "saeko", "feel", "shame", "past", "taro", "ghost", "urg", "yosuk", "fulfil", "desir", "relationship", "surviv"], "tmdb_score_value": 6.3, "tmdb_score_count": 12, "imdb_score_value": 6.9, "imdb_score_count": 2263, "meta_score_value": 69.0, "meta_score_count": 17}
