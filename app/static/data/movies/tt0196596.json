After his mother dies, his usually-absent father, whom he barely knows, takes him into these same wilds to hunt for a grizzly. They find a mother bear with two cubs. The hunters capture the cubs, but the grizzly captures the lad. Somehow, boy and bear bond and trek across the forest with dad and a First Nations friend on their trail. After a while, the boy figures out where he and his new mother are going: toward her cubs. Rifles, dogs, hunters, bear, cubs, father, and son are headed for a rendezvous.", "tokens": ["out", "wild", "ag", "man", "tell", "grandchildren", "tale", "youth", "after", "mother", "di", "usual", "absent", "father", "bare", "know", "take", "wild", "hunt", "grizzli", "thei", "find", "mother", "bear", "two", "cub", "the", "hunter", "captur", "cub", "grizzli", "captur", "lad", "somehow", "boi", "bear", "bond", "trek", "across", "forest", "dad", "first", "nation", "friend", "trail", "after", "boi", "figur", "new", "mother", "go", "toward", "cub", "rifl", "dog", "hunter", "bear", "cub", "father", "son", "head", "rendezv"], "tmdb_score_value": 5.6, "tmdb_score_count": 5, "imdb_score_value": 6.0, "imdb_score_count": 496, "meta_score_value": 34.0, "meta_score_count": 10}
