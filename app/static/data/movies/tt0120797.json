They thrive on the no-room-for-error, fast-paced job and let it infect their lives. The undisputed king of pushing tin, \"The Zone\" Falzone, rules his workplace and his wedded life with the same short-attention span that gets planes where they need to be in the nick of time. That is, until Russell Bell, a new transfer with a reputation for recklessness but a record of pure perfection shatters the tensely-held status quo. The game of one-upmanship between the two flies so high as to lead Nick into Russell's bed with his wife. His sanity slipping just as fast as his hold on #1, Cusack's controller is thrown out-of-control when Thornton's wanderer quietly leaves town. Nick must now find a way to regain his sanity and repair his marriage before he breaks down completely.", "tmdb_score_value": 5.8, "tmdb_score_count": 146, "imdb_score_value": 6.0, "imdb_score_count": 26136, "meta_score_value": 47.0, "meta_score_count": 29}
