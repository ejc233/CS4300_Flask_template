He's born Catholic and poor; later he rejects religion. He discovers homo-eroticism, and it's tinged with Catholic guilt. Enjoying pop music gives way to a teenage love of Mahler and Wagner. Using archival footage, we take a ferry to a day on the beach. Postwar prosperity brings some positive change, but its concrete architecture is dispiriting. Contemporary colors and sights of children playing may balance out the presence of unemployment and persistent poverty. Davies' narration is a mix of his own reflections and the poems and prose of others.", "tokens": ["of", "time", "the", "citi", "love", "song", "eulogi", "director", "birthplac", "liverpool", "it", "also", "respons", "memori", "reflect", "experi", "lose", "sens", "place", "skylin", "chang", "time", "take", "toll"], "tmdb_score_value": 7.3, "tmdb_score_count": 12, "imdb_score_value": 7.3, "imdb_score_count": 1657, "meta_score_value": 81.0, "meta_score_count": 9}
