Bajirao is described as \"RANMARD\" a man made of and for the battlefield. Bajirao said to his brother \"Remember that night has nothing to do with sleep. It was created by God, to raid territory held by your enemy. The night is your shield, your screen against the cannons and swords of vastly superior enemy forces. \" A born cavalry leader Bajirao was unequaled for the daring and originality of his genius.

An expert dancer, singer and warrior, Mastani is sent to battle at the head of the Bundelkhand army.
