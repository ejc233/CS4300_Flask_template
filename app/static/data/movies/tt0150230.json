He talks fast, is in love with the city, and dispenses historical facts, architectural analysis, and philosophical musings in equal measures. He's reflective and funny about cruising: he loves it, got in it to meet women, and he'd quit work if he could. His personal life is disclosed in small doses: he takes home $200 a week for 20 hours work, home is his suitcase and wherever he can flop, he's been arrested for going out on the roof tops of skyscrapers to see his city; he stands between the towers of the World Trade Center, spins until he's dizzy, then looks up.", "tokens": ["affection", "portrait", "tim", "speed", "levitch", "tour", "guid", "manhattan", "grai", "line", "doubl", "decker", "buse", "he", "talk", "fast", "love", "citi", "dispens", "histor", "fact", "architectur", "analysi", "philosoph", "muse", "equal", "measur", "he", "reflect", "funni", "cruis", "love", "got", "meet", "women", "quit", "work", "could", "hi", "person", "life", "disclos", "small", "dose", "take", "home", "$200", "week", "20", "hour", "work", "home", "suitcas", "wherev", "flop", "arrest", "go", "roof", "top", "skyscrap", "see", "citi", "stand", "tower", "world", "trade", "center", "spin", "dizzi", "look"], "tmdb_score_value": 7.8, "tmdb_score_count": 9, "imdb_score_value": 7.8, "imdb_score_count": 1470, "meta_score_value": 69.0, "meta_score_count": 13}
