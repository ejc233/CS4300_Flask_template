But the cartoonist becomes a prisoner of his own fantasies when Holli transports Jack into Cool World with a scheme to seduce him and bring herself to life. A hard-boiled detective--the only other human in Cool World--cautions Jack with the law: Noids (humans) don't have sex with doodles (cartoons). However, the flesh proves weaker than ink as Holli takes human form in Las Vegas, staring in a trans-universal chase that threatens the destruction of both worlds. With a splashy combination of animation and live-action sequences, \"Cool World\" delivers the hottest action around.", "tmdb_score_value": 5.0, "tmdb_score_count": 173, "imdb_score_value": 4.8, "imdb_score_count": 18242, "meta_score_value": 28.0, "meta_score_count": 16}
