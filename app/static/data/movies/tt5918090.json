However, during the couple's separation, Qin falls in love with another woman--and as if his divorce with Li was real--he decides to move on with his life, leaving the jilted former spouse out in the cold. Under those circumstances and in the dreadful position of being denounced as a Pan Jinlian--a 17th-century Chinese adulteress who conspired with her partner to kill her husband--Li sets off on a legal crusade to clear her name. But even though Li is undoubtedly determined, on the other hand, she is nothing but a small nuisance in a sluggish and bureaucratic system where, sometimes, ants can become elephants. In the end, how long can a single woman hold on against an entire government?", "tokens": ["have", "option", "li", "xuelian", "poorli", "educ", "villag", "husband", "qin", "yuhe", "agre", "fake", "divorc", "howev", "coupl", "separ", "qin", "fall", "love", "anoth", "woman", "divorc", "li", "real", "decid", "move", "life", "leav", "jilt", "former", "spous", "cold", "under", "circumst", "dread", "posit", "denounc", "pan", "jinlian", "17th", "centuri", "chines", "adulteress", "conspir", "partner", "kill", "husband", "li", "set", "legal", "crusad", "clear", "name", "but", "even", "though", "li", "undoubtedli", "determin", "hand", "noth", "small", "nuisanc", "sluggish", "bureaucrat", "system", "sometim", "ant", "becom", "eleph", "in", "end", "long", "singl", "woman", "hold", "entir", "govern"], "tmdb_score_value": 7.6, "tmdb_score_count": 15, "imdb_score_value": 7.0, "imdb_score_count": 1462, "meta_score_value": 65.0, "meta_score_count": 13}
