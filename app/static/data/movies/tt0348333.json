Dan, the clueless boss, assigns Mitch, 22, a trainee, to Monty, the smooth talker who chases girls for one-night stands. Dean, a waiter, also 22, feels that life is passing him by.

During this shift, Monty may learn something, Dean makes his decision, Dan makes a play for the not-yet-18 hostess, customers get their comeuppance, the guys all play the in-house homophobic flashing game, the gals demonstrate why they won't, and Mitch gets the last word.", "tmdb_score_value": 6.2, "tmdb_score_count": 283, "imdb_score_value": 6.8, "imdb_score_count": 80635, "meta_score_value": 30.0, "meta_score_count": 26}
