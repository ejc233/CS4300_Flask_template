The only problem is that she's not real - she's a sex doll Lars ordered off the Internet. But sex is not what Lars has in mind, but rather a deep, meaningful relationship. His sister-in-law is worried for him, his brother thinks he's nuts, but eventually the entire town goes along with his delusion in support of this sweet natured boy that they've always loved.", "tmdb_score_value": 7.1, "tmdb_score_count": 681, "imdb_score_value": 7.4, "imdb_score_count": 125844, "meta_score_value": 70.0, "meta_score_count": 32}
