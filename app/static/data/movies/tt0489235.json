Jeff, the surviving teen, goes in search of his hero, over-the-hill B-movie star, Bruce Campbell. Jeff kidnaps the actor and brings him to Gold Lick to save the town. Bruce thinks it's a birthday treat engineered by his agent, so he plays along, humoring the townsfolk and chatting up Jeff's unimpressed mom. Bodies pile up as the demon slashes. What will the sorry, boozy Bruce do when he realizes that Guan-Di, the demon, is for real?", "tmdb_score_value": 5.9, "tmdb_score_count": 130, "imdb_score_value": 6.3, "imdb_score_count": 22400, "meta_score_value": 36.0, "meta_score_count": 14}
