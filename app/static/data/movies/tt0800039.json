He weeps, he rails, he mopes. Finally, his step-brother Brian suggests Hawaii, so Peter heads for a resort on Oahu where, as he's checking in, he sees Sarah and her new beau, Aldous, a polymorphously perverse English rocker. The weeping and moping start again, until Peter is rescued by Rachel, a thoughtful hotel clerk who invites him to a luau and to hang out. Although he constantly runs into Sarah and Aldous, Peter starts to come alive again. Will Sarah realize what she's lost, and what about Rachel?", "tmdb_score_value": 6.4, "tmdb_score_count": 1443, "imdb_score_value": 7.2, "imdb_score_count": 235869, "meta_score_value": 67.0, "meta_score_count": 37}
