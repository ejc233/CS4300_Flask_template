Just before closing time he picks up Glen but what's expected to be just a one-night stand becomes something else, something special. That weekend, in bars and in bedrooms, getting drunk and taking drugs, telling stories and having sex, the two men get to know each other. It is a brief encounter that will resonate throughout their lives. Weekend is both an honest and unapologetic love story between two guys and a film about the universal struggle for an authentic life in all its forms. It is about the search for identity and the importance of making a passionate commitment to your life.", "tmdb_score_value": 7.4, "tmdb_score_count": 207, "imdb_score_value": 7.7, "imdb_score_count": 23460, "meta_score_value": 81.0, "meta_score_count": 18}
