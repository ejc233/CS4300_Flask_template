Determined to recover, Dickens decides to write a Christmas story and self-publish it in less than two months. As Dickens labors writing on such short notice, his estranged father and mother come to bunk with him. Still haunted by painful memories of his father ruining his childhood by his financial irresponsibly, Dickens develops a writer's block which seems to have no solution. As such, Dickens must face his personal demons epitomized through his characters, especially in his imagined conversations with Ebenezer Scrooge. Now with a looming deadline, Dickens struggles for inspiration against his frustrations and his characters' opinions in a literary challenge creating a classic tale that would define the essential soul of modern Christmas.", "tokens": ["in", "1843", "celebr", "british", "novelist", "charl", "dicken", "low", "point", "career", "three", "flop", "behind", "famili", "expens", "pile", "home", "determin", "recov", "dicken", "decid", "write", "christma", "stori", "self", "publish", "less", "two", "month", "as", "dicken", "labor", "write", "short", "notic", "estrang", "father", "mother", "come", "bunk", "still", "haunt", "pain", "memori", "father", "ruin", "childhood", "financi", "irrespons", "dicken", "develop", "writer", "block", "seem", "solut", "as", "dicken", "must", "face", "person", "demon", "epitom", "charact", "especi", "imagin", "convers", "ebenez", "scroog", "now", "loom", "deadlin", "dicken", "struggl", "inspir", "frustrat", "charact", "opinion", "literari", "challeng", "creat", "classic", "tale", "would", "defin", "essenti", "soul", "modern", "christma"], "tmdb_score_value": 6.0, "tmdb_score_count": 123, "imdb_score_value": 7.0, "imdb_score_count": 3915, "meta_score_value": 60.0, "meta_score_count": 32}
