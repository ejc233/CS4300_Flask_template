To make ends meet, and against his better judgement, he takes a job as a croupier. He finds himself drawn into the casino world and the job gradually takes over his life; his relationship with girlfriend Marion begins to deteriorate. One gambler in particular catches his attention: Jani, whom he starts to see outside of working hours - a serious violation of casino rules. Jani is down on her luck; under pressure from her creditors she approaches Jack, asking him to be the inside man for a planned heist at the casino. Jack carefully considers the odds; it all looks so simple, but even a professional like Jack can't predict the cards he will be dealt.", "tokens": ["jack", "manfr", "aspir", "writer", "go", "nowher", "fast", "to", "make", "end", "meet", "better", "judgement", "take", "job", "croupier", "he", "find", "drawn", "casino", "world", "job", "gradual", "take", "life", "relationship", "girlfriend", "marion", "begin", "deterior", "on", "gambler", "particular", "catch", "attent", "jani", "start", "see", "outsid", "work", "hour", "seriou", "violat", "casino", "rule", "jani", "luck", "pressur", "creditor", "approach", "jack", "ask", "insid", "man", "plan", "heist", "casino", "jack", "carefulli", "consid", "odd", "look", "simpl", "even", "profession", "like", "jack", "predict", "card", "dealt"], "tmdb_score_value": 6.7, "tmdb_score_count": 95, "imdb_score_value": 7.2, "imdb_score_count": 16846, "meta_score_value": 75.0, "meta_score_count": 28}
