But those gigs are declining, so he jumps at the chance to write a song and record it with reigning teen idol Cora Corman. Trouble is, he's good at melodies but needs a lyricist and has less than a week to finish. Enter Sophie Fisher, subbing for a friend who waters Alex's plants; she's a pretty good poet, quick witted, and could do it, if she'd agree. But there's some sort of shadow over her head that Alex may not be able to charm his way past. And what if they do get a song written, what then?", "tmdb_score_value": 6.2, "tmdb_score_count": 695, "imdb_score_value": 6.5, "imdb_score_count": 88022, "meta_score_value": 59.0, "meta_score_count": 30}
