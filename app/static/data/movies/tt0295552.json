His wife lives in Washington, D.C.; his restaurant, the Auk, in an out-of-the-way Newfoundland inlet, is a bust; a drink is rarely out of reach. An odd-duck of a neighbor, Phonce, who has found ten kilos of cocaine and wants Dave's help selling it, contrives to keep Dave in town by faking and reporting the sighting of a rare bird. Soon birders descend from everywhere, and the restaurant is a success. Dave is snorting the cocaine and falling for a young visitor who helps him out at the Auk, Phonce is launching his recreational submarine, and various men who don't look like birders are poking about. When the chickens come home to roost, will Dave and Phonse have a Plan B?", "tokens": ["dave", "hi", "wife", "live", "washington", "d", "c", "restaur", "auk", "wai", "newfoundland", "inlet", "bust", "drink", "rare", "reach", "an", "odd", "duck", "neighbor", "phonc", "found", "ten", "kilo", "cocain", "want", "dave", "help", "sell", "contriv", "keep", "dave", "town", "fake", "report", "sight", "rare", "bird", "soon", "birder", "descend", "everywher", "restaur", "success", "dave", "snort", "cocain", "fall", "young", "visitor", "help", "auk", "phonc", "launch", "recreat", "submarin", "variou", "men", "look", "like", "birder", "poke", "when", "chicken", "come", "home", "roost", "dave", "phons", "plan", "b"], "tmdb_score_value": 5.8, "tmdb_score_count": 9, "imdb_score_value": 6.5, "imdb_score_count": 1441, "meta_score_value": 60.0, "meta_score_count": 5}
