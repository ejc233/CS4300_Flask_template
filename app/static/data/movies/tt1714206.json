It's a good place for him. A high school senior, charming and self-possessed, he's the life of the party, loves his job at a men's clothing store, and has no plans for the future. A budding alcoholic, he's never far from his supersized, whiskey-fortified thirst-master cup. But after being dumped by his girlfriend, Sutter gets drunk and wakes up on a lawn with Aimee Finecky hovering over him. She's different: the \"nice girl\" who reads science fiction and doesn't have a boyfriend. While Aimee has dreams of a future, Sutter lives in the impressive delusion of a spectacular now, yet somehow, they're drawn together.", "tmdb_score_value": 6.7, "tmdb_score_count": 1343, "imdb_score_value": 7.1, "imdb_score_count": 124151, "meta_score_value": 82.0, "meta_score_count": 42}
