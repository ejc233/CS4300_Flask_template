Her husband, G\u00e9rard, a businessman and philanderer, hates the campaign and feels vindication when a nasty leaflet circulates about their family history. His son, Fran\u00e7ois, just back from the U.S., is in love with his step-sister Mich\u00e8le, and she with him, although something is amiss besides their being cousins. Watching it all is their elderly Aunt Line, who has her own haunting memories. A death in World War II and a death on election night collapse time in the perpetual present and bring unexpected expiation. There's a lot to celebrate.", "tokens": ["ann", "run", "elect", "town", "council", "shepherd", "matthieu", "fellow", "candid", "campaign", "manag", "her", "husband", "g\u00e9rard", "businessman", "philander", "hate", "campaign", "feel", "vindic", "nasti", "leaflet", "circul", "famili", "histori", "hi", "son", "fran\u00e7oi", "back", "u", "s", "love", "step", "sister", "mich\u00e8l", "although", "someth", "amiss", "besid", "cousin", "watch", "elderli", "aunt", "line", "haunt", "memori", "a", "death", "world", "war", "ii", "death", "elect", "night", "collaps", "time", "perpetu", "present", "bring", "unexpect", "expiat", "there", "lot", "celebr"], "tmdb_score_value": 5.9, "tmdb_score_count": 12, "imdb_score_value": 6.6, "imdb_score_count": 2727, "meta_score_value": 67.0, "meta_score_count": 24}
