Driven by a commitment to bear witness to the wars of our time after the events of 9/11, Chris was among the first in a new generation of war photographers since Vietnam. HONDROS explores the complexities inherent in covering more than a decade of conflict, while trying to maintain a normal life. It also examines the unknowable calculus involved in making split-second life and death decisions -- before, during and after his photos were made. Chris was killed in Libya in 2011, but he left a lasting impact on his profession that is still felt today.", "tokens": ["hondro", "follow", "life", "career", "famou", "war", "photograph", "chri", "hondro", "explor", "poignant", "often", "surpris", "stori", "behind", "award", "win", "photojournalist", "best", "known", "photo", "driven", "commit", "bear", "wit", "war", "time", "event", "9/11", "chri", "among", "first", "new", "gener", "war", "photograph", "sinc", "vietnam", "hondro", "explor", "complex", "inher", "cover", "decad", "conflict", "try", "maintain", "normal", "life", "it", "also", "examin", "unknow", "calculu", "involv", "make", "split", "second", "life", "death", "decis", "photo", "made", "chri", "kill", "libya", "2011", "left", "last", "impact", "profess", "still", "felt", "todai"], "tmdb_score_value": 6.0, "tmdb_score_count": 1, "imdb_score_value": 7.7, "imdb_score_count": 52, "meta_score_value": 68.0, "meta_score_count": 5}
