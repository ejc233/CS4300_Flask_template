In his teens, Orton is befriended by the older, more reserved Kenneth Halliwell, and while the two begin a relationship, it's fairly obvious that it's not all about sex. Orton loves the dangers of bath-houses and liaisons in public restrooms; Halliwell, not as charming or attractive as Orton, doesn't fare so well in those environs. While both long to become writers, it is Orton who achieves fame - his plays \"Entertaining Mr. Sloane\" and \"Loot\" become huge hits in London of the sixties, and he's even commissioned to write a screenplay for the Beatles. But Orton's success takes him farther from Halliwell, whose response ended both his life and the life of the up-and-coming playwright.", "tokens": ["thi", "film", "stori", "spectacular", "life", "violent", "death", "british", "playwright", "joe", "orton", "in", "teen", "orton", "befriend", "older", "reserv", "kenneth", "halliwel", "two", "begin", "relationship", "fairli", "obviou", "sex", "orton", "love", "danger", "bath", "hous", "liaison", "public", "restroom", "halliwel", "charm", "attract", "orton", "fare", "well", "environ", "while", "long", "becom", "writer", "orton", "achiev", "fame", "plai", "entertain", "mr", "sloan", "loot", "becom", "huge", "hit", "london", "sixti", "even", "commiss", "write", "screenplai", "beatl", "but", "orton", "success", "take", "farther", "halliwel", "whose", "respons", "end", "life", "life", "come", "playwright"], "tmdb_score_value": 6.1, "tmdb_score_count": 29, "imdb_score_value": 7.4, "imdb_score_count": 4992, "meta_score_value": 72.0, "meta_score_count": 17}
