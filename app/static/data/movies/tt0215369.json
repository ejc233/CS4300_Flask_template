He finds his father hard at work at the family's bathhouse (the false message was a ruse of Da's mentally-handicapped, exuberant brother, Er Ming, to get Da home). Da stays a couple days, observing his father being social director, marriage counselor, and dispute mediator for his customers and a boon companion to Er. Da is caught between worlds: the decaying district of his childhood and the booming south where he now lives with a wife who's not met his family. When Da realizes his father's health is failing and the district is slated for razing, he must take stock of family and future.", "tokens": ["shenzhen", "businessman", "da", "ming", "goe", "home", "beij", "think", "father", "di", "he", "find", "father", "hard", "work", "famili", "bathhous", "fals", "messag", "ruse", "da", "mental", "handicap", "exuber", "brother", "er", "ming", "get", "da", "home", "da", "stai", "coupl", "dai", "observ", "father", "social", "director", "marriag", "counselor", "disput", "mediat", "custom", "boon", "companion", "er", "da", "caught", "world", "decai", "district", "childhood", "boom", "south", "live", "wife", "met", "famili", "when", "da", "realiz", "father", "health", "fail", "district", "slate", "raze", "must", "take", "stock", "famili", "futur"], "tmdb_score_value": 6.8, "tmdb_score_count": 21, "imdb_score_value": 7.5, "imdb_score_count": 3616, "meta_score_value": 74.0, "meta_score_count": 26}
