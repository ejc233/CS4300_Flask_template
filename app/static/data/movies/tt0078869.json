The Palomino attempts a dangerous fly-by of the darkened ship. As they come within close range of it, the buffeting they experience (due to the black hole's gravity) suddenly ceases. They bring more instruments to bear on the derelict, but do not even realize the gravity-free zone is artificial; slipping outside it, they are almost drawn into the black hole, an abyss from which no one can escape. Matters worsen when Reinhardt holds the crew captive, after realizing that they can help him reach his goal. ...", "tmdb_score_value": 5.9, "tmdb_score_count": 154, "imdb_score_value": 5.9, "imdb_score_count": 19908, "meta_score_value": 0.0, "meta_score_count": 0}
