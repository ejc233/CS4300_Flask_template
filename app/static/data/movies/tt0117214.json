Twenty years ago the director had wounded the policeman with a knife in an attempt to disarm him to take his gun. The filmmaker, who fought against the Shah's regime, was arrested and spent several years in prison. So, today, he proposes to man to reconstruct the story cinematically: each of them will choose a guy to play their roles. The boys chosen take things very seriously and, in the end, will not fight, but rather, will offer one another... the bread and flowers!", "tokens": ["a", "forti", "year", "old", "ex", "cop", "goe", "tehran", "meet", "director", "makmalbaf", "act", "latest", "film", "twenti", "year", "ago", "director", "wound", "policeman", "knife", "attempt", "disarm", "take", "gun", "the", "filmmak", "fought", "shah", "regim", "arrest", "spent", "sever", "year", "prison", "so", "todai", "propos", "man", "reconstruct", "stori", "cinemat", "choos", "gui", "plai", "role", "the", "boi", "chosen", "take", "thing", "serious", "end", "fight", "rather", "offer", "on", "anoth", "bread", "flower"], "tmdb_score_value": 7.9, "tmdb_score_count": 30, "imdb_score_value": 8.0, "imdb_score_count": 2343, "meta_score_value": 70.0, "meta_score_count": 9}
