TV producer Tommy, who's just broken up with his girlfriend, has a short relationship with commitment-phobe Maria, who he meets in a video store, and also hooks up with married real-estate agent Annie, who he meets while apartment hunting. Annie is open to a relationship because her husband, Griffin, is cheating on her, which she slowly comes to realize through talking to her friend/co-worker who's gone through the same thing. Griffin, a 39-year-old dentist, is cheating with 19-year-old waitress Ashley, who he picked up in a park; she realizes she can do better when Ben, a hotel doorman and aspiring musician, tries to pick her up, in a belated attempt to recover from his divorce a year ago from schoolteacher Maria (the same Maria from the video store). Most of these relationships seem driven more by a desperate need to be in a relationship than actual love.", "tokens": ["six", "new", "yorker", "interrel", "seri", "relationship", "tv", "produc", "tommi", "broken", "girlfriend", "short", "relationship", "commit", "phobe", "maria", "meet", "video", "store", "also", "hook", "marri", "real", "estat", "agent", "anni", "meet", "apart", "hunt", "anni", "open", "relationship", "husband", "griffin", "cheat", "slowli", "come", "realiz", "talk", "friend/co", "worker", "gone", "thing", "griffin", "39", "year", "old", "dentist", "cheat", "19", "year", "old", "waitress", "ashlei", "pick", "park", "realiz", "better", "ben", "hotel", "doorman", "aspir", "musician", "tri", "pick", "belat", "attempt", "recov", "divorc", "year", "ago", "schoolteach", "maria", "maria", "video", "store", "most", "relationship", "seem", "driven", "desper", "need", "relationship", "actual", "love"], "tmdb_score_value": 5.8, "tmdb_score_count": 19, "imdb_score_value": 6.5, "imdb_score_count": 5960, "meta_score_value": 49.0, "meta_score_count": 29}
