As Bob the Tomato and the kids settle in to wait for a tow truck to help get their van back on the road, the \"Pirates Who Don't Do Anything\" share a little story about a guy named Jonah. Jonah was kind of like a mailman except his messages came straight from God. Jonah loves his job, until the day comes when he has to deliver a message to the people of Nineveh. Instead of carrying out his mission, Jonah turns and sets sail in the opposite direction onboard a pirate ship. Soon Jonah embarks on an adventure that leads him into the belly of a whale, and to the heart of Nineveh for a hilarious showdown.", "tokens": ["when", "sing", "veggi", "encount", "car", "troubl", "strand", "old", "rundown", "seafood", "joint", "noth", "quit", "seem", "as", "bob", "tomato", "kid", "settl", "wait", "tow", "truck", "help", "get", "van", "back", "road", "pirat", "who", "don", "do", "anyth", "share", "littl", "stori", "gui", "name", "jonah", "jonah", "kind", "like", "mailman", "except", "messag", "came", "straight", "god", "jonah", "love", "job", "dai", "come", "deliv", "messag", "peopl", "nineveh", "instead", "carri", "mission", "jonah", "turn", "set", "sail", "opposit", "direct", "onboard", "pirat", "ship", "soon", "jonah", "embark", "adventur", "lead", "belli", "whale", "heart", "nineveh", "hilari", "showdown"], "tmdb_score_value": 6.4, "tmdb_score_count": 27, "imdb_score_value": 6.6, "imdb_score_count": 3396, "meta_score_value": 58.0, "meta_score_count": 20}
