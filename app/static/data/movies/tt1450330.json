But the band's Arena-Rock glory days are a distant memory. County fairs and club gigs pay the bills. And Jimmy has become a casualty of these leaner times. With no place to go, no job prospects, and no real skills outside of being a roadie, Jimmy needs to regroup. So he returns to his childhood home in Queens, Ny. There, he revisits old relationships: his ailing, widower mom, a high school crush, a former nemesis and, most importantly, his relationship with himself. Jimmy, the middle-aged man-child, has never grown up. He still carries the resentments and frustrations of his youth, and has allowed them to fester and define who and what he is. Confronted with his mother's illness, Jimmy has a choice: let go of the past and take responsibility for both himself and the woman who raised and now needs him. Or continue to live a life of lies and frustration.", "tokens": ["for", "20", "year", "jimmi", "testagross", "live", "childhood", "dream", "roadi", "childhood", "hero", "blue", "oyster", "cult", "but", "band", "arena", "rock", "glori", "dai", "distant", "memori", "counti", "fair", "club", "gig", "pai", "bill", "and", "jimmi", "becom", "casualti", "leaner", "time", "with", "place", "go", "job", "prospect", "real", "skill", "outsid", "roadi", "jimmi", "need", "regroup", "so", "return", "childhood", "home", "queen", "ny", "there", "revisit", "old", "relationship", "ail", "widow", "mom", "high", "school", "crush", "former", "nemesi", "importantli", "relationship", "jimmi", "middl", "ag", "man", "child", "never", "grown", "he", "still", "carri", "resent", "frustrat", "youth", "allow", "fester", "defin", "confront", "mother", "ill", "jimmi", "choic", "let", "go", "past", "take", "respons", "woman", "rais", "need", "or", "continu", "live", "life", "li", "frustrat"], "tmdb_score_value": 6.2, "tmdb_score_count": 10, "imdb_score_value": 6.0, "imdb_score_count": 1023, "meta_score_value": 61.0, "meta_score_count": 10}
