The husband, a photographer, seeks help at a nearby village and encounters a teacher who offers to help. Whilst the husband and teacher go off to find a spare part, the wife, who used to be a teacher, takes over the teaching lessons in the village. It is clear that the children live there, in this strange deserted place, without any men, save the teacher and an old signal guard. As the day draws on, the children help to bring a new hope and life into the wife's heart.", "tokens": ["on", "pilgrimag", "mashad", "tehran", "coupl", "transport", "break", "far", "major", "town", "the", "husband", "photograph", "seek", "help", "nearbi", "villag", "encount", "teacher", "offer", "help", "whilst", "husband", "teacher", "go", "find", "spare", "part", "wife", "us", "teacher", "take", "teach", "lesson", "villag", "it", "clear", "children", "live", "strang", "desert", "place", "without", "men", "save", "teacher", "old", "signal", "guard", "as", "dai", "draw", "children", "help", "bring", "new", "hope", "life", "wife", "heart"], "tmdb_score_value": 6.3, "tmdb_score_count": 3, "imdb_score_value": 6.8, "imdb_score_count": 520, "meta_score_value": 75.0, "meta_score_count": 12}
