Trevor's efforts to make good on his idea bring a revolution not only in the lives of himself, his mother and his physically and emotionally scarred teacher, but in those of an ever-widening circle of people completely unknown to him.", "tmdb_score_value": 7.0, "tmdb_score_count": 601, "imdb_score_value": 7.2, "imdb_score_count": 103568, "meta_score_value": 40.0, "meta_score_count": 34}
