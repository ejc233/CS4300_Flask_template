They describe the memory to the staff who work with a crew to film it and screen it at week's end; eternity follows. 22 dead arrive that week, assigned to three counselors and a trainee. One old man cannot find a memory, so he watches videotape of his life. Others pick their memory quickly, and the film crew gets right to work. The trainee, 18-year-old Shiori, helps a teenage girl choose a memory other than Disneyland. The youthful staff have a secret and feelings, too, which play out, especially Shiori's affection for her mentor, Mochizuki", "tokens": ["life", "truli", "known", "suffer", "lose", "endur", "advers", "stumbl", "defeat", "defeat", "anai", "nin"], "tmdb_score_value": 7.2, "tmdb_score_count": 61, "imdb_score_value": 7.8, "imdb_score_count": 7942, "meta_score_value": 91.0, "meta_score_count": 19}
