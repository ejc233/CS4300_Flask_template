They often clash with their now elderly parents over this and blame them for their problems in their adult life. However, the two become worried when they're told by the police that their parents have gone missing during their trip outside of town. The brother considers the possibility that something horrible might have happened to them, but the sister is convinced that it's just another one of their stupid games or twisted conceptual performances. She convinces him that they should go and look for them themselves.", "tokens": ["anni", "baxter", "adult", "children", "controversi", "husband", "wife", "conceptu", "perform", "art", "coupl", "famou", "quirki", "macabr", "public", "perform", "never", "got", "fact", "parent", "kept", "us", "childhood", "often", "gori", "disturb", "satir", "public", "perform", "thei", "often", "clash", "elderli", "parent", "blame", "problem", "adult", "life", "howev", "two", "becom", "worri", "told", "polic", "parent", "gone", "miss", "trip", "outsid", "town", "the", "brother", "consid", "possibl", "someth", "horribl", "might", "happen", "sister", "convinc", "anoth", "on", "stupid", "game", "twist", "conceptu", "perform", "she", "convinc", "go", "look"], "tmdb_score_value": 5.8, "tmdb_score_count": 127, "imdb_score_value": 6.1, "imdb_score_count": 6154, "meta_score_value": 67.0, "meta_score_count": 28}
