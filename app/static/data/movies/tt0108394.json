Despite her intentions, people from her former and present life intrude with their own needs. However, the reality created by the people who need and care about her, a surprising discovery and the music around which the film revolves heal Julie and draws her back to the land of the living.", "tmdb_score_value": 7.7, "tmdb_score_count": 416, "imdb_score_value": 8.0, "imdb_score_count": 71596, "meta_score_value": 85.0, "meta_score_count": 9}
