But Candice is living far away from the city. Born in a remote area of France, she manages to become a model for the small cheese factory based in the area. She becomes a star; but only a local one. The two will meet but only after Candice has been found dead. Cause of death: suicide by sleeping pills. Rousseau is the only one who doesn't buy it and who wants to know the true cause of her death. In his search for the truth, he will be confronted with many difficulties: becoming a detective-novelist and getting respect from the locals, and going beyond what some people want to keep secret forever.", "tokens": ["rousseau", "parisian", "bestsel", "crime", "novelist", "work", "new", "novel", "desper", "look", "good", "stori", "candic", "lecoeur", "young", "attract", "vibrant", "woman", "think", "reincarn", "marilyn", "monro", "but", "candic", "live", "far", "awai", "citi", "born", "remot", "area", "franc", "manag", "becom", "model", "small", "chees", "factori", "base", "area", "she", "becom", "star", "local", "on", "the", "two", "meet", "candic", "found", "dead", "caus", "death", "suicid", "sleep", "pill", "rousseau", "on", "bui", "want", "know", "true", "caus", "death", "in", "search", "truth", "confront", "mani", "difficulti", "becom", "detect", "novelist", "get", "respect", "local", "go", "beyond", "peopl", "want", "keep", "secret", "forev"], "tmdb_score_value": 6.1, "tmdb_score_count": 32, "imdb_score_value": 6.7, "imdb_score_count": 2285, "meta_score_value": 63.0, "meta_score_count": 12}
