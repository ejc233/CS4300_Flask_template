Nobody wants the prize more than young Charlie, but as his family is so poor that buying even one bar of chocolate is a treat, buying enough bars to find one of the five golden tickets is unlikely in the extreme. But in movieland, magic can happen. Charlie, along with four somewhat odious other children, get the chance of a lifetime and a tour of the factory. Along the way, mild disasters befall each of the odious children, but can Charlie beat the odds and grab the brass ring?", "tmdb_score_value": 7.4, "tmdb_score_count": 1104, "imdb_score_value": 7.8, "imdb_score_count": 148403, "meta_score_value": 67.0, "meta_score_count": 10}
