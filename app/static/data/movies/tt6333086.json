Since his wife passed away a year before, he has been trying hard to regain custody of his nine-year-old son, Rieven. But the rabbi (and all the community behind him) will not hear of it unless he re-marries, which Menashe does not want, his first marriage having been very unhappy. Father and son get on well together, but can Menashe take care of Rieven properly? Not really for all his goodwill as he holds down a low-paid job as a grocery clerk that consumes too much of his efforts and energy. Always late, always in a hurry, he endeavors to improve himself though. But will his efforts be enough to convince the rabbi that he can be a good father without a wife at home?", "tokens": ["menash", "widow", "live", "work", "within", "hasid", "commun", "borough", "park", "brooklyn", "sinc", "wife", "pass", "awai", "year", "try", "hard", "regain", "custodi", "nine", "year", "old", "son", "rieven", "but", "rabbi", "commun", "behind", "hear", "unless", "marri", "menash", "want", "first", "marriag", "unhappi", "father", "son", "get", "well", "togeth", "menash", "take", "care", "rieven", "properli", "not", "realli", "goodwil", "hold", "low", "paid", "job", "groceri", "clerk", "consum", "much", "effort", "energi", "alwai", "late", "alwai", "hurri", "endeavor", "improv", "though", "but", "effort", "enough", "convinc", "rabbi", "good", "father", "without", "wife", "home"], "tmdb_score_value": 6.6, "tmdb_score_count": 12, "imdb_score_value": 6.5, "imdb_score_count": 1055, "meta_score_value": 81.0, "meta_score_count": 27}
