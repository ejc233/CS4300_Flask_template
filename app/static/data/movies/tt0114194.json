He may want to put religion behind him, but one morning a weird, eyeless, hermaphroditic corpse turns up. Suddenly he is on a path that will put him right in the middle of a war in Heaven. And once again, Heaven will show him too much: gore, blood, charred flesh, living corpses and much worse. Even more central to the heavenly war effort is a young girl. This American Indian child has something Gabriel wants. And Gabriel is willing to kill her and anyone in his path - or even reanimate a corpse or two - to get it.", "tmdb_score_value": 6.4, "tmdb_score_count": 161, "imdb_score_value": 6.6, "imdb_score_count": 26091, "meta_score_value": 0.0, "meta_score_count": 0}
