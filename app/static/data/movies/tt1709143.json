Unwilling to let the relief crew claim the glory, he disobeys orders to pack up, and goes out on an unauthorised expedition to collect further samples. But a routine excavation turns to disaster, when the porous ground collapses, and he falls into a deep crevice and near certain death. His devastated colleagues attempt to recover his body. However, when another vanishes, they begin to realise; the life-form they've discovered is highly dangerous to all human life.", "tokens": ["nine", "astronaut", "endur", "six", "month", "mission", "mar", "hope", "find", "sign", "life", "iron", "find", "death", "form", "bacteri", "infect", "transform", "victim", "on", "on", "zombi", "like", "creatur", "as", "zombi", "count", "increas", "number", "live", "astronaut", "decreas", "race", "time", "unfold", "astronaut", "hope", "return", "earth", "safe"], "tmdb_score_value": 5.2, "tmdb_score_count": 346, "imdb_score_value": 5.5, "imdb_score_count": 31772, "meta_score_value": 46.0, "meta_score_count": 21}
