She's quick, witty, ironic, literary, and independent; he's deliberate, literal, serious, studying structural engineering, always working on a plan.

Her response is to skitter away from continued intimacy and want to stay friends; he's hurt by her response, so he withdraws. Can it all get sorted out before she leaves town?", "tmdb_score_value": 5.3, "tmdb_score_count": 128, "imdb_score_value": 5.4, "imdb_score_count": 14638, "meta_score_value": 29.0, "meta_score_count": 26}
