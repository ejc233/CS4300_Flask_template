His mother wants help moving Uncle Rollie, who's facing his own fading memory, into a care home. Cooper's boss tells him to take a few days, so Cooper drives home. Rollie doesn't want to move, and his salvation may be a rare baseball card of a 1908 Chicago Cub. Maybe they can sell it in Chicago for enough for Rollie to live at home with help. Cooper teams up with Charlotte, his recently-divorced high-school flame, and her son; they take Rollie to a memorabilia market. Rollie insists on keeping the card in his pocket, while more than one rascal wants to divest the old man of his treasure. Can the underdogs carry the day?", "tokens": ["cooper", "chicago", "journalist", "post", "concuss", "memori", "loss", "hi", "mother", "want", "help", "move", "uncl", "rolli", "face", "fade", "memori", "care", "home", "cooper", "boss", "tell", "take", "dai", "cooper", "drive", "home", "rolli", "want", "move", "salvat", "mai", "rare", "basebal", "card", "1908", "chicago", "cub", "mayb", "sell", "chicago", "enough", "rolli", "live", "home", "help", "cooper", "team", "charlott", "recent", "divorc", "high", "school", "flame", "son", "take", "rolli", "memorabilia", "market", "rolli", "insist", "keep", "card", "pocket", "on", "rascal", "want", "divest", "old", "man", "treasur", "can", "underdog", "carri", "dai"], "tmdb_score_value": 6.2, "tmdb_score_count": 3, "imdb_score_value": 5.7, "imdb_score_count": 1085, "meta_score_value": 54.0, "meta_score_count": 13}
