However, prodded by his major conservative supporter, Houston Socialite Joanne Herring, Wilson learns about the plight the people are suffering in the brutal Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. With the help of the maverick CIA agent, Gustav \"Gust\" Avrakotos, Wilson dedicates his canny political efforts to supply the Afghan mujahideen with the weapons and support to defeat the Soviet Union. However, Charlie Wilson eventually learns that while military victory can be had, there are other consequences and prices to that fight that are ignored to everyone's sorrow.", "tmdb_score_value": 6.5, "tmdb_score_count": 443, "imdb_score_value": 7.1, "imdb_score_count": 96195, "meta_score_value": 69.0, "meta_score_count": 39}
