As Adam navigates the romantic relationship waters, Mike struggles connecting to his former drug-addicted son who has just returned home, and Neil develops a relationship with another woman in his sex addicts group, but a platonic friendship might be exactly what he needs.", "tmdb_score_value": 5.8, "tmdb_score_count": 225, "imdb_score_value": 6.4, "imdb_score_count": 23044, "meta_score_value": 54.0, "meta_score_count": 38}
