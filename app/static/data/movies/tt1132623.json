Support comes from his sister, a lab tech, the Hemlock Society president, and a lawyer. The child of survivors of the Armenian genocide interviews applicants: his sister video tapes them. He assembles a device allowing a person to initiate a three-chemical intravenous drip. The local D.A., the governor, and the Legislature respond. In court scenes, Kevorkian is sometimes antic. He's single-minded about giving dying individuals the right to determine how their lives will end. He wants the Supreme Court to rule. He picks a fight he can't win: is it hubris or heroism?", "tmdb_score_value": 6.9, "tmdb_score_count": 131, "imdb_score_value": 7.7, "imdb_score_count": 23874, "meta_score_value": 0.0, "meta_score_count": 0}
