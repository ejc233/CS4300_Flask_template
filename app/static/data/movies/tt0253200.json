The movie follows his mates, Ray, Lenny and Vic and his son Vince as they journey to the sea with the ashes. Along the way, the threads of their lives, their loves and their disappointments are woven together in their memories of Jack and his wife Amy", "tokens": ["jack", "dodd", "london", "butcher", "enjoi", "pint", "mate", "50", "year", "when", "di", "di", "live", "smile", "face", "watch", "hors", "race", "bet", "borrow", "monei", "but", "di", "final", "request", "last", "order", "ash", "scatter", "sea", "margat", "the", "movi", "follow", "mate", "rai", "lenni", "vic", "son", "vinc", "journei", "sea", "ash", "along", "wai", "thread", "live", "love", "disappoint", "woven", "togeth", "memori", "jack", "wife", "ami"], "tmdb_score_value": 5.9, "tmdb_score_count": 26, "imdb_score_value": 7.0, "imdb_score_count": 5275, "meta_score_value": 78.0, "meta_score_count": 31}
