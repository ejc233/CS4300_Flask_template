Though apprenticed to an itinerant barber surgeon, it is the dazzling surgery of a Jewish physician trained by the legendary Persian physician Avicenna that inspires him to accept his gift and to commit his life to healing by studying at Avicenna's school. Despite the ban on Christian students, Rob goes there, disguising himself as a Jew to gain admission. Gordon has written an adventurous and inspiring tale of a quest for medical knowledge pursued in a violent world full of superstition and prejudice.", "tmdb_score_value": 7.2, "tmdb_score_count": 433, "imdb_score_value": 7.2, "imdb_score_count": 30470, "meta_score_value": 0.0, "meta_score_count": 0}
