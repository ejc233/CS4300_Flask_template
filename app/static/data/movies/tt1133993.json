But when she surprises him at their country home, she is more than slightly dismayed that the roses and romantic set-up are not for her but for his much younger mistress. Louise takes matters into her own hands, and abducts Ian duct-taping him to the toilet, where he must admit to his true feelings and he is unable to leave her. Things grow exceedingly awry for everybody when a burglar shows up at their house, and then everybody must discover and admit to their true feelings.", "tokens": ["louis", "want", "find", "wai", "reconnect", "husband", "ian", "divorc", "mani", "year", "marriag", "but", "surpris", "countri", "home", "slightli", "dismai", "rose", "romant", "set", "much", "younger", "mistress", "louis", "take", "matter", "hand", "abduct", "ian", "duct", "tape", "toilet", "must", "admit", "true", "feel", "unabl", "leav", "thing", "grow", "exceedingli", "awri", "everybodi", "burglar", "show", "hous", "everybodi", "must", "discov", "admit", "true", "feel"], "tmdb_score_value": 5.0, "tmdb_score_count": 61, "imdb_score_value": 5.4, "imdb_score_count": 7163, "meta_score_value": 36.0, "meta_score_count": 16}
