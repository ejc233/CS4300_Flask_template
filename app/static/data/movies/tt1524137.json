He left that life behind, got married, has a family and went legit. But when his brother-in-law got involved with Briggs, a drug dealer and when he blew a deal, Briggs demands restitution which he can't deliver. So Chris offers to find a way to pay Briggs but then he threatens Chris' family if he doesn't deliver. So he gets on a freighter destined for Panama and he sets out to bring back some counterfeit currency. Briggs \"goes to see\" Chris' family. When Chris learns of this he asks his friend Sebastian to take care of them which he does. He tells Chris that it would be better to bring drugs instead of the cash.", "tmdb_score_value": 6.1, "tmdb_score_count": 870, "imdb_score_value": 6.5, "imdb_score_count": 107802, "meta_score_value": 51.0, "meta_score_count": 38}
