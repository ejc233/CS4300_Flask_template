When the pair link Harriet's disappearance to a number of grotesque murders from almost forty years ago, they begin to unravel a dark and appalling family history; but, the Vangers are a secretive clan, and Blomkvist and Salander are about to find out just how far they are prepared to go to protect themselves.", "tmdb_score_value": 7.5, "tmdb_score_count": 1219, "imdb_score_value": 7.8, "imdb_score_count": 189222, "meta_score_value": 76.0, "meta_score_count": 36}
