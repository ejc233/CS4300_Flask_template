In Belfast in the 1980s, they could have been enemies, but instead they became business partners. After persuading a mad wig salesman, known as the Scalper, to sell them his leads, the two embark on a series of house calls--always in neighborhoods that are dangerous for one or the other partner. Then they find out they may lose their exclusive wig distributorship to competitors. Through a series of comic twists, the pair are given large orders for wigs by both sides of the Protestant/Catholic conflict. Should they compromise their principles in order to keep their business? Will it destroy their friendship? Could one of their wigs in the hands of the IRA actually put one or both of them in jail or even get them killed?", "tokens": ["colm", "cathol", "georg", "poetri", "love", "protest", "in", "belfast", "1980", "could", "enemi", "instead", "becam", "busi", "partner", "after", "persuad", "mad", "wig", "salesman", "known", "scalper", "sell", "lead", "two", "embark", "seri", "hous", "call", "alwai", "neighborhood", "danger", "on", "partner", "then", "find", "mai", "lose", "exclus", "wig", "distributorship", "competitor", "through", "seri", "comic", "twist", "pair", "given", "larg", "order", "wig", "side", "protestant/cathol", "conflict", "should", "compromis", "principl", "order", "keep", "busi", "will", "destroi", "friendship", "could", "on", "wig", "hand", "ira", "actual", "put", "on", "jail", "even", "get", "kill"], "tmdb_score_value": 6.0, "tmdb_score_count": 2, "imdb_score_value": 6.3, "imdb_score_count": 1455, "meta_score_value": 56.0, "meta_score_count": 18}
