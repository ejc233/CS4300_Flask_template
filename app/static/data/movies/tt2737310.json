After ten years as a band, and five critically acclaimed albums, they were finally enjoying wider recognition. Lead singer Matt Berninger invited his younger brother, Tom, to join the tour's crew. A budding horror filmmaker, Tom - who is nine years younger than Matt and listens exclusively to heavy metal - decided to bring his camera along. Tom's at sea in the world of indie rock, and living in his brother's shadow brings out the younger sibling in him - he drinks, complains, and struggles to balance his ambition with his tour responsibilities. The result is a film about brothers and about making something of your own.", "tokens": ["in", "2010", "rock", "band", "the", "nation", "embark", "biggest", "tour", "career", "after", "ten", "year", "band", "five", "critic", "acclaim", "album", "final", "enjoi", "wider", "recognit", "lead", "singer", "matt", "berning", "invit", "younger", "brother", "tom", "join", "tour", "crew", "a", "bud", "horror", "filmmak", "tom", "nine", "year", "younger", "matt", "listen", "exclus", "heavi", "metal", "decid", "bring", "camera", "along", "tom", "sea", "world", "indi", "rock", "live", "brother", "shadow", "bring", "younger", "sibl", "drink", "complain", "struggl", "balanc", "ambit", "tour", "respons", "the", "result", "film", "brother", "make", "someth"], "tmdb_score_value": 7.2, "tmdb_score_count": 27, "imdb_score_value": 7.3, "imdb_score_count": 3921, "meta_score_value": 72.0, "meta_score_count": 19}
