At great risk, and at considerable personal cost, the team's mission was accomplished - or was it? The suspense builds in and across two different time periods, with startling action and surprising revelations.", "tmdb_score_value": 6.3, "tmdb_score_count": 323, "imdb_score_value": 6.9, "imdb_score_count": 59022, "meta_score_value": 65.0, "meta_score_count": 37}
