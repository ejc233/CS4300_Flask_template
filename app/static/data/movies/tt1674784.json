He's just back from a business trip (he brokers diamonds) and their teen daughter Avery is sneaking out to a party, when four thugs in security uniforms and ski masks stage a home invasion. They want what's in the safe: cash and diamonds. Kyle stalls them, trying to negotiate for Sarah's freedom. Over the next few hours, the back stories of the four robbers (two brothers, a girlfriend, and the representative of a local drug kingpin) as well as the fault lines in Kyle and Sarah's marriage come into play. Is there room here for heroism?", "tmdb_score_value": 5.3, "tmdb_score_count": 419, "imdb_score_value": 5.3, "imdb_score_count": 37674, "meta_score_value": 37.0, "meta_score_count": 19}
