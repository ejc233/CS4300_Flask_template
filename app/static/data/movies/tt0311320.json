She worked for him at the Wolfsschanze in Obersalzberg, on his private train and, finally, in his bunker in the besieged capital. It was Traudl Junge to whom Hitler dictated his final testament. In her first ever on-camera interview, 81-year-old Junge talks about her unique life. In the spring of 2001, Andre Heller succeeded in convincing Traudl Junge how valuable it is to record her unique memories. Fifty-six years after the end of the Second World War, an important eyewitness reveals her experiences to us. What she saw and heard turned her into an furious opponent of National Socialism; an opponent, moreover, who is still painfully aware and seems incapable of forgiving the young girl she once was--for her naivete, ignorance, and her liking for Hitler.", "tokens": ["traudl", "jung", "adolf", "hitler", "privat", "secretari", "autumn", "1942", "collaps", "nazi", "regim", "she", "work", "wolfsschanz", "obersalzberg", "privat", "train", "final", "bunker", "besieg", "capit", "it", "traudl", "jung", "hitler", "dictat", "final", "testament", "in", "first", "ever", "camera", "interview", "81", "year", "old", "jung", "talk", "uniqu", "life", "in", "spring", "2001", "andr", "heller", "succeed", "convinc", "traudl", "jung", "valuabl", "record", "uniqu", "memori", "fifti", "six", "year", "end", "second", "world", "war", "import", "eyewit", "reveal", "experi", "us", "what", "saw", "heard", "turn", "furiou", "oppon", "nation", "social", "oppon", "moreov", "still", "painfulli", "awar", "seem", "incap", "forgiv", "young", "girl", "naivet", "ignor", "like", "hitler"], "tmdb_score_value": 6.3, "tmdb_score_count": 8, "imdb_score_value": 7.3, "imdb_score_count": 1531, "meta_score_value": 79.0, "meta_score_count": 30}
