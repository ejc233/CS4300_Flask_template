THE WITNESS begins in 2004 when The Times questions its original story: the number of witnesses, what they observed, the number of attacks. None was more affected by the story than Bill. He vowed not to be like the 38, volunteered for Vietnam, and lost both legs. What if Kitty's mythic story is an urban myth? Breaking his family's half-century of silence, Bill seeks to find the truth confronting the witnesses, the killer, their families and his own. THE WITNESS is about bearing witness, loss and forgiveness, and what we owe each other.", "tokens": ["bill", "genoves", "decad", "long", "journei", "unravel", "truth", "mythic", "death", "littl", "known", "life", "sister", "kitti", "reportedli", "stab", "front", "38", "wit", "becam", "face", "urban", "apathi", "the", "wit", "begin", "2004", "the", "time", "question", "origin", "stori", "number", "wit", "observ", "number", "attack", "none", "affect", "stori", "bill", "he", "vow", "like", "38", "volunt", "vietnam", "lost", "leg", "what", "kitti", "mythic", "stori", "urban", "myth", "break", "famili", "half", "centuri", "silenc", "bill", "seek", "find", "truth", "confront", "wit", "killer", "famili", "the", "wit", "bear", "wit", "loss", "forgiv", "ow"], "tmdb_score_value": 7.0, "tmdb_score_count": 41, "imdb_score_value": 7.1, "imdb_score_count": 2905, "meta_score_value": 79.0, "meta_score_count": 18}
