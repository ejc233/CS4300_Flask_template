Her dreams are quickly exploited and smothered by two competing self-obsessed, sociopathic, chauvinistic weirdos. She submits to the will of one of the weirdos: an abusive, mustachioed dwarf in women's apparel who haunts the streets of Minneapolis upon a purple motorcycle, even during cold weather. The culmination of her humiliation occurs during the film's climax: her dreams finally in ruins due to the results of a musical competition at a popular nightclub, the purple dwarf celebrates by performing a vulgar act of self-pleasure on stage with a guitar which she purchased for him with hocked jewelry.", "tmdb_score_value": 6.7, "tmdb_score_count": 116, "imdb_score_value": 6.5, "imdb_score_count": 16599, "meta_score_value": 55.0, "meta_score_count": 14}
