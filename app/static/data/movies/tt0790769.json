The conversations heard in the film have never before been made public and they reveal a highly personal portrait of an artist much discussed but not particularly well understood.", "tokens": ["an", "intim", "move", "medit", "late", "musician", "artist", "kurt", "cobain", "base", "25", "hour", "previous", "unheard", "audiotap", "interview", "conduct", "cobain", "note", "music", "journalist", "michael", "azerrad", "book", "come", "as", "you", "ar", "the", "stori", "nirvana", "in", "film", "kurt", "cobain", "recount", "life", "childhood", "adolesc", "dai", "music", "discoveri", "later", "deal", "explos", "fame", "offer", "often", "pierc", "insight", "life", "music", "time", "the", "convers", "heard", "film", "never", "made", "public", "reveal", "highli", "person", "portrait", "artist", "much", "discuss", "particularli", "well", "understood"], "tmdb_score_value": 7.1, "tmdb_score_count": 24, "imdb_score_value": 7.4, "imdb_score_count": 3265, "meta_score_value": 69.0, "meta_score_count": 17}
