She meets some new people there including Binder ('Shane Dawson') while at a party and she learns about an urban legend of an online killer that has the nickname \"Smiley\" who can only be seen on the web and he apparently kills people after they type in \"I did it for the lulz\" three times. Soon after going to the party Ashley and her flatmate Proxy go online to test it out, with horrific results. She becomes paranoid and she starts to think she sees Smiley all over the place and feels that he may be chasing her, but how can that be if he is not real? Have they somehow released him from the internet?", "tokens": ["ashlei", "goe", "new", "colleg", "get", "death", "mother", "she", "meet", "new", "peopl", "includ", "binder", "shane", "dawson", "parti", "learn", "urban", "legend", "onlin", "killer", "nicknam", "smilei", "seen", "web", "appar", "kill", "peopl", "type", "i", "lulz", "three", "time", "soon", "go", "parti", "ashlei", "flatmat", "proxi", "go", "onlin", "test", "horrif", "result", "she", "becom", "paranoid", "start", "think", "see", "smilei", "place", "feel", "mai", "chase", "real", "have", "somehow", "releas", "internet"], "tmdb_score_value": 4.3, "tmdb_score_count": 139, "imdb_score_value": 3.5, "imdb_score_count": 7719, "meta_score_value": 25.0, "meta_score_count": 8}
