Many rumors spread around the great Pyramids of Gizeh (the only one of the seven wonders of the world left), their age ranges - in different theories - between 3,000 and even 12,000 years. Here, an old Egyptian is asked by his granddaughter about those mysteries of which we all heard in one way or the other. The action takes us to Howard Carter, who, after years and years of searching, finally found King Tutankhamen's (Tut-ench-Amun) grave in 1922. This was a major event in archaeology, as this grave was never robbed and therefore in the same condition as it was left (est.) 1339 B.C. We also get to see the Nile's wells and other historic landmarks that make Egypt an important part of world history.", "tokens": ["egypt", "ever", "place", "mysteri", "mani", "rumor", "spread", "around", "great", "pyramid", "gizeh", "on", "seven", "wonder", "world", "left", "ag", "rang", "differ", "theori", "3", "000", "even", "12", "000", "year", "here", "old", "egyptian", "ask", "granddaught", "mysteri", "heard", "on", "wai", "the", "action", "take", "us", "howard", "carter", "year", "year", "search", "final", "found", "king", "tutankhamen", "tut", "ench", "amun", "grave", "1922", "thi", "major", "event", "archaeolog", "grave", "never", "rob", "therefor", "condit", "left", "est", "1339", "b", "c", "we", "also", "get", "see", "nile", "well", "histor", "landmark", "make", "egypt", "import", "part", "world", "histori"], "tmdb_score_value": 5.6, "tmdb_score_count": 4, "imdb_score_value": 6.6, "imdb_score_count": 447, "meta_score_value": 53.0, "meta_score_count": 4}
