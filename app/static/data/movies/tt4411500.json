Once Arthur realizes what the filmmakers are up to, his protective measure is to hide behind a mask, keeping the filmmakers questioning: are any of Arthur's moments on camera truthful or is it all just a performance in the end?", "tokens": ["be", "show", "busi", "tough", "actor", "denver", "tougher", "perform", "full", "time", "comput", "repairman", "arthur", "martinez", "hire", "two", "indi", "filmmak", "make", "featur", "film", "lead", "realiz", "head", "you", "gui", "ruin", "life", "arthur", "sai", "on", "moment", "immedi", "follow", "thi", "best", "film", "i", "ever", "the", "filmmak", "scrap", "genr", "film", "arthur", "intend", "make", "instead", "quickli", "design", "entir", "new", "project", "base", "around", "real", "life", "persona", "becom", "elus", "product", "steam", "ahead", "onc", "arthur", "realiz", "filmmak", "protect", "measur", "hide", "behind", "mask", "keep", "filmmak", "question", "arthur", "moment", "camera", "truth", "perform", "end"], "tmdb_score_value": 2.0, "tmdb_score_count": 1, "imdb_score_value": 5.6, "imdb_score_count": 76, "meta_score_value": 60.0, "meta_score_count": 9}
