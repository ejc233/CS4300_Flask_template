Because the other electives are closed, he finds himself with a large class of seeming gang-bangers, and the principal informs him that drama will be cut next trimester. On the advice of a student reviewer, Dana decides to stage his own play, a sequel to \"Hamlet\" in which the prince and Jesus, with the use of a time machine, try to save Gertrude and Ophelia.
