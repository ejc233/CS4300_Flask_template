The reason why they are abducted becomes clear as there is a horrible secret in the town where girls have gone missing each Spring for many years, and this year is no different. Meanwhile a group of kidnappers are plotting to take the child of a prominent business man and his wife. They take the child and go to a farm where they wait to get their ransom. The two groups collide when Rachel escapes but is chased by a stranger wearing a mask of some sort. She runs to the farm where the kidnappers are and all hell breaks loose.", "tokens": ["thi", "movi", "rachel", "friend", "taken", "someon", "car", "park", "chang", "tire", "thei", "wake", "strang", "barn", "ti", "frighten", "thei", "know", "thing", "go", "get", "wors", "the", "reason", "abduct", "becom", "clear", "horribl", "secret", "town", "girl", "gone", "miss", "spring", "mani", "year", "year", "differ", "meanwhil", "group", "kidnapp", "plot", "take", "child", "promin", "busi", "man", "wife", "thei", "take", "child", "go", "farm", "wait", "get", "ransom", "the", "two", "group", "collid", "rachel", "escap", "chase", "stranger", "wear", "mask", "sort", "she", "run", "farm", "kidnapp", "hell", "break", "loos"], "tmdb_score_value": 4.2, "tmdb_score_count": 25, "imdb_score_value": 4.5, "imdb_score_count": 1851, "meta_score_value": 33.0, "meta_score_count": 5}
