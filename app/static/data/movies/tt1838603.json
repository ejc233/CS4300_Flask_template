He lives in Paris and speaks no French. Since his wife's death, he's marking time. His curiosity is piqued when he meets Pauline Laubie, half his age, a dance instructor. She's also a solitary person but wants the connection of family. She believes she's found that in Matthew, and she attends to him during a hospitalization. When his two adult children arrive from the U.S. to check on their father, they are certain Pauline is a gold digger, and she's confounded by the distance between father and children. The daughter heads home, the son remains. Is there any way that Pauline fits in?", "tokens": ["matthew", "morgan", "retir", "american", "professor", "80", "widow", "he", "live", "pari", "speak", "french", "sinc", "wife", "death", "mark", "time", "hi", "curios", "piqu", "meet", "paulin", "laubi", "half", "ag", "danc", "instructor", "she", "also", "solitari", "person", "want", "connect", "famili", "she", "believ", "found", "matthew", "attend", "hospit", "when", "two", "adult", "children", "arriv", "u", "s", "check", "father", "certain", "paulin", "gold", "digger", "confound", "distanc", "father", "children", "the", "daughter", "head", "home", "son", "remain", "is", "wai", "paulin", "fit"], "tmdb_score_value": 6.8, "tmdb_score_count": 114, "imdb_score_value": 6.8, "imdb_score_count": 10788, "meta_score_value": 36.0, "meta_score_count": 13}
