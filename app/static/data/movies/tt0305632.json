Her son Scott is mortified. He still can't believe that his father - a world-class athlete - actually drowned. When Maureen and Oliver announce wedding-plans, Scott's world begins to fall apart. Oliver's attractive daughter Kelly shares Scott's distrust of the impending marriage - and proposes a theory of her own: is it possible that Maureen and Oliver have known each other longer than just a few weeks; and if so, could they have possibly killed Scott's father? The two start to investigate - and soon fall in love. But while they are united by a horrible suspicion, the investigation soon reveals some secrets that keep them apart. Scott has to realize that he can truly trust no one - not Oliver, not Maureen and definitely not Kelly.", "tokens": ["onli", "week", "husband", "mysteri", "death", "maureen", "return", "cruis", "handsom", "brit", "oliv", "vanc", "tow", "her", "son", "scott", "mortifi", "he", "still", "believ", "father", "world", "class", "athlet", "actual", "drown", "when", "maureen", "oliv", "announc", "wed", "plan", "scott", "world", "begin", "fall", "apart", "oliv", "attract", "daughter", "kelli", "share", "scott", "distrust", "impend", "marriag", "propos", "theori", "possibl", "maureen", "oliv", "known", "longer", "week", "could", "possibl", "kill", "scott", "father", "the", "two", "start", "investig", "soon", "fall", "love", "but", "unit", "horribl", "suspicion", "investig", "soon", "reveal", "secret", "keep", "apart", "scott", "realiz", "truli", "trust", "on", "oliv", "maureen", "definit", "kelli"], "tmdb_score_value": 3.8, "tmdb_score_count": 4, "imdb_score_value": 3.4, "imdb_score_count": 1255, "meta_score_value": 13.0, "meta_score_count": 9}
