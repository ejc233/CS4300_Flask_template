Ajay has secretly seduced Seema, the elder daughter of business tycoon Madan Chopra and on the side, he also makes acquaintance of Chopra and his younger daughter Priya at a car race in Madras. Ajay promises to marry Seema but betrays and murders her by throwing her off the roof of a building, making it look like a suicide with the help of a faked suicide note which he obtained from Seema under false pretext. He then adopts the identity of Vicky Malhotra, makes the vulnerable Priya fall in love with him and also wins Chopra's trust. However, Priya refuses to believe that her sister committed suicide and keeps investigating, which forces Ajay/Vicky to murder anyone who could possibly help her discover the truth.", "tmdb_score_value": 7.0, "tmdb_score_count": 38, "imdb_score_value": 7.8, "imdb_score_count": 21265, "meta_score_value": 0.0, "meta_score_count": 0}
