Into their lives comes a mysterious new boarder, who befriends the boy but generates distrust from the mother. As time passes, the man and boy share confidences and special powers are revealed. The man warns the boy to be on the lookout for the \"lowmen\", who were seeking him. The two share a summer's adventures and come to love one another before the inevitable happens.
