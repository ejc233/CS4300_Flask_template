With the entire gruesome ordeal recorded on tape, Stretch seeks out the help of a former Texas Marshall who's on a personal quest of vengeance against this family of cannibals. While at first he turns her down, he eventually decides to use her tape to his advantage, asking her to air it during her request block- effectively baiting the cannibals to the radio station where he'll personally deal with them.", "tmdb_score_value": 5.8, "tmdb_score_count": 196, "imdb_score_value": 5.6, "imdb_score_count": 22387, "meta_score_value": 0.0, "meta_score_count": 0}
