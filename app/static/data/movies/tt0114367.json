Col. Hendricksson (Peter Weller) is commander of a handful of Alliance soldiers still alive on Sirius 6B. Betrayed by his own political leaders and disgusted by the atrocities of this never-ending war, Hendricksson decides he must negotiate a separate peace with the New Economic Bloc's decimated forces. But to do so, he will have to cross a treacherous wasteland where the deadliest threat comes from the very weapons he helped to create.", "tmdb_score_value": 6.0, "tmdb_score_count": 186, "imdb_score_value": 6.4, "imdb_score_count": 22120, "meta_score_value": 0.0, "meta_score_count": 0}
