They are, in short, in that uneasy transition from hipster to yuppie, and they're asking themselves that universal question of all thirtysomething married couples: How The Hell Did That Happen? In an effort to rekindle their relationship, they set out on a trip that lands them back in their old neighborhood, in a trendy section of Los Angeles. A few drinks bring back a few memories, and Neil and Sarah end up breaking into the apartment they used to share, squatting illegally for a few days in their twentysomething lives. After throwing a raging \"housewarming\" party, Neil and Sarah must rely on their grown-up resources to avoid some serious consequences.", "tokens": ["neil", "sarah", "us", "talk", "band", "love", "talk", "gift", "card", "thei", "short", "uneasi", "transit", "hipster", "yuppi", "ask", "univers", "question", "thirtysometh", "marri", "coupl", "how", "the", "hell", "did", "that", "happen", "in", "effort", "rekindl", "relationship", "set", "trip", "land", "back", "old", "neighborhood", "trendi", "section", "lo", "angel", "a", "drink", "bring", "back", "memori", "neil", "sarah", "end", "break", "apart", "us", "share", "squat", "illeg", "dai", "twentysometh", "live", "after", "throw", "rage", "housewarm", "parti", "neil", "sarah", "must", "reli", "grown", "resourc", "avoid", "seriou", "consequ"], "tmdb_score_value": 4.8, "tmdb_score_count": 6, "imdb_score_value": 5.7, "imdb_score_count": 216, "meta_score_value": 34.0, "meta_score_count": 6}
