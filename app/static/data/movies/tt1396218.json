When he grows up he spends most of time on his work and ignores his children. One day his father sends him an unusual gift: a penguin. Popper can't help but wonder why his father would send him a penguin. He tries to get rid of it, but accidentally orders five more. When his children and ex-wife show up to celebrate his son's birthday, the kids are taken with the penguins. And Popper finally gets to connect with his kids while his work suffers.", "tokens": ["tom", "popper", "grew", "littl", "interact", "father", "explor", "world", "when", "grow", "spend", "time", "work", "ignor", "children", "on", "dai", "father", "send", "unusu", "gift", "penguin", "popper", "help", "wonder", "father", "would", "send", "penguin", "he", "tri", "get", "rid", "accident", "order", "five", "when", "children", "ex", "wife", "show", "celebr", "son", "birthdai", "kid", "taken", "penguin", "and", "popper", "final", "get", "connect", "kid", "work", "suffer"], "tmdb_score_value": 5.7, "tmdb_score_count": 1019, "imdb_score_value": 6.0, "imdb_score_count": 75465, "meta_score_value": 53.0, "meta_score_count": 30}
