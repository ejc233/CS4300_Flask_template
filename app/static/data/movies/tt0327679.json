She must obey anything anyone tells her to do. When her mother passes away, she is cared for by her thoughtless and greedy father who remarries a loathsome woman with two treacherous daughters. This modern-day, fantasy Cinderella story features fairies, ogres and elves...as well as a hero in the guise of Prince Charmont, whom Ella falls in love with. Unlike Cinderella though, she must depend on herself and her intelligence to get her through her troubles and find Lucinda in order for her \"curse\" to be broken!", "tmdb_score_value": 6.0, "tmdb_score_count": 585, "imdb_score_value": 6.3, "imdb_score_count": 53569, "meta_score_value": 53.0, "meta_score_count": 30}
