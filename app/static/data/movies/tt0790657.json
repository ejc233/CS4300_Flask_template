Jake Bianski runs a fish market in north Boston, surrounded by Italians. For years, he's carried a torch for Isabella, an ex-girlfriend now married with three children and no interest in Jake. Yet, he tells everyone she's his girlfriend, including Marisa, a veterinarian his employees set him up with at the Italian singles club. She's interested in him until he tells her about his girlfriend, then he's persistent in asking her to be his friend. As the friendship bumps along, Jake realizes that reality may be better than fantasy, but what if Isabella changes her mind about Jake, and what if it comes out that Marisa, like Jake, isn't Italian?", "tokens": ["ar", "relationship", "base", "li", "jake", "bianski", "run", "fish", "market", "north", "boston", "surround", "italian", "for", "year", "carri", "torch", "isabella", "ex", "girlfriend", "marri", "three", "children", "interest", "jake", "yet", "tell", "everyon", "girlfriend", "includ", "marisa", "veterinarian", "employe", "set", "italian", "singl", "club", "she", "interest", "tell", "girlfriend", "persist", "ask", "friend", "as", "friendship", "bump", "along", "jake", "realiz", "realiti", "mai", "better", "fantasi", "isabella", "chang", "mind", "jake", "come", "marisa", "like", "jake", "italian"], "tmdb_score_value": 5.5, "tmdb_score_count": 12, "imdb_score_value": 5.9, "imdb_score_count": 1637, "meta_score_value": 26.0, "meta_score_count": 7}
