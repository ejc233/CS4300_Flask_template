A suburban family moves to a new neighborhood in Orange County, California with their large, yet lovable Great Dane, who has a tendency to wreak havoc in his own oblivious way. But it's not all living large for the Duke, who finds that fitting in with his new four-legged friends, and a potential romantic interest, isn't always easy for a super-sized teenage dog. Owen Wilson gives the beloved Great Dane his voice in the film, which also features the voices of Fergie, George Lopez, Emma Stone, and Kiefer Sutherland.", "tmdb_score_value": 5.0, "tmdb_score_count": 215, "imdb_score_value": 4.2, "imdb_score_count": 12531, "meta_score_value": 30.0, "meta_score_count": 22}
