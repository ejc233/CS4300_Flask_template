After police officers find them in a peep-show cabin and shoot Eddie, Karen becomes emotionally disturbed and loses her memory. Hoping to conquer her inner demons, she heads for the Colony, a secluded retreat where the creepy residents are rather too eager to make her feel at home. There also seems to be a bizarre connection between Eddie Quist and this supposedly safe haven. And when, after nights of being tormented by unearthly cries, Karen ventures into the forest and makes a terrifying discovery.", "tmdb_score_value": 6.4, "tmdb_score_count": 205, "imdb_score_value": 6.6, "imdb_score_count": 25639, "meta_score_value": 68.0, "meta_score_count": 11}
