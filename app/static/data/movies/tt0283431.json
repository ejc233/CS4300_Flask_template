However, her sister wasn't so lucky; she lost her legs to a land mine while young, and when Nafas and her family left the country, her sister was accidentally left behind. Nafas receives a letter from her sister announcing that she's decided to commit suicide during the final eclipse before the dawn of the 21st century; desperate to spare her sister's life, Nafas makes haste to Afghanistan, where she joins a caravan of refugees who, for a variety of reasons, are returning to the war-torn nation. As Nafas searches for her sister, she soon gets a clear and disturbing portrait of the toll the Taliban regime has taken upon its people.", "tokens": ["nafa", "report", "born", "afghanistan", "fled", "famili", "canada", "child", "howev", "sister", "lucki", "lost", "leg", "land", "mine", "young", "nafa", "famili", "left", "countri", "sister", "accident", "left", "behind", "nafa", "receiv", "letter", "sister", "announc", "decid", "commit", "suicid", "final", "eclips", "dawn", "21st", "centuri", "desper", "spare", "sister", "life", "nafa", "make", "hast", "afghanistan", "join", "caravan", "refuge", "varieti", "reason", "return", "war", "torn", "nation", "as", "nafa", "search", "sister", "soon", "get", "clear", "disturb", "portrait", "toll", "taliban", "regim", "taken", "upon", "peopl"], "tmdb_score_value": 6.2, "tmdb_score_count": 29, "imdb_score_value": 6.8, "imdb_score_count": 6009, "meta_score_value": 76.0, "meta_score_count": 28}
