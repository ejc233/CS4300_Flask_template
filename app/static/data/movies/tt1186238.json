His older brother dedicated his life to being David's second. He sees little of his fianc\u00e9e. His parents also assist his success. We watch him train and then fight: he's swift and theatrical. His is one of several voices explaining the sport and its meaning in Spain. Protestors speak out as well. Injury is close at hand. We watch El Fandi in surgery after a goring; he returns that day to the ring. We see gallantry, courage, and showmanship. Will he reach his goal?", "tokens": ["we", "follow", "david", "fandila", "el", "fandi", "1981", "2003", "2004", "2005", "three", "bullfight", "season", "spain", "seek", "becom", "13th", "person", "histori", "kill", "100", "bull", "season", "hi", "older", "brother", "dedic", "life", "david", "second", "he", "see", "littl", "fianc\u00e9", "hi", "parent", "also", "assist", "success", "we", "watch", "train", "fight", "swift", "theatric", "hi", "on", "sever", "voic", "explain", "sport", "mean", "spain", "protestor", "speak", "well", "injuri", "close", "hand", "we", "watch", "el", "fandi", "surgeri", "gore", "return", "dai", "ring", "we", "see", "gallantri", "courag", "showmanship", "will", "reach", "goal"], "tmdb_score_value": 0.0, "tmdb_score_count": 0, "imdb_score_value": 6.9, "imdb_score_count": 123, "meta_score_value": 56.0, "meta_score_count": 4}
