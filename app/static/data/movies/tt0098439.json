However, when Perret manages to incriminate the pesty team with falsified evidence, Ray and Gabe will soon end up in a maximum-security prison, where an almost endless parade of inmates previously incarcerated by them, are waiting for their captors impatiently. Now, more than ever, Tango and Cash need to put their differences aside to come up quickly with a good plan, not only to escape the jail's walls but also to even the score with the evil kingpin who put them behind bars once and for all. Of course, that's easier said than done.", "tmdb_score_value": 6.1, "tmdb_score_count": 587, "imdb_score_value": 6.4, "imdb_score_count": 83708, "meta_score_value": 41.0, "meta_score_count": 15}
