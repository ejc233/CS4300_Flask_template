She's taken a job as a tour guide, but she hates it and it shows: the tourists, mostly American, are bored with history and facts; they want to shop. Every group has a goofy couple, a frat boy, a sullen teen, a feuding couple, divorc\u00e9es looking for a mate, and a funny guy. This group is no exception, plus there's no air conditioning and a bearded silent driver. Thanks to an unlikely friendship, plus daisies, an ice-cream cone, the history of syrup, and the Oracle at Delphi, Georgia may have a shot at finding her kefi during this four-day tour.", "tmdb_score_value": 5.7, "tmdb_score_count": 146, "imdb_score_value": 5.9, "imdb_score_count": 16518, "meta_score_value": 34.0, "meta_score_count": 25}
