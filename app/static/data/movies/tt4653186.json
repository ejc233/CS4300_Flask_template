At that time, the only thing he knows about her are the myths and predominantly negative stories his father told him. She was a femme fatale who went through countless men, a famous model in the 1950s, and a mother that put her two sons into a children's home. Fassaert decides to accept her invitation. But when his grandmother makes an unexpected confession, his venture becomes much more complicated than he could ever have imagined.", "tokens": ["on", "30th", "birthdai", "tom", "fassaert", "receiv", "mysteri", "invit", "95", "year", "old", "grandmoth", "mariann", "come", "visit", "south", "africa", "at", "time", "thing", "know", "myth", "predominantli", "neg", "stori", "father", "told", "she", "femm", "fatal", "went", "countless", "men", "famou", "model", "1950", "mother", "put", "two", "son", "children", "home", "fassaert", "decid", "accept", "invit", "but", "grandmoth", "make", "unexpect", "confess", "ventur", "becom", "much", "complic", "could", "ever", "imagin"], "tmdb_score_value": 5.3, "tmdb_score_count": 12, "imdb_score_value": 7.2, "imdb_score_count": 320, "meta_score_value": 75.0, "meta_score_count": 7}
