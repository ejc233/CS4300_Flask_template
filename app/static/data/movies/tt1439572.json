At first, it's an outbreak of loss of smell. It's often presaged by a destructive temper tantrum. In this mix are a scientist and a chef - she's Susan, one of a team trying to understand the epidemic; he's Michael, charming and engaging. Susan and Michael begin a relationship in the middle of increasing chaos, as the loss of other senses plagues more people and as civil authorities try to maintain order. Susan's voice-over reflections provide insight. Is love possible in such a changed world? Can anything make perfect sense?", "tmdb_score_value": 6.8, "tmdb_score_count": 381, "imdb_score_value": 7.1, "imdb_score_count": 48224, "meta_score_value": 55.0, "meta_score_count": 18}
