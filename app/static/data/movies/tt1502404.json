In three days, King and his followers will sacrifice the child at midnight. Milton picks up the trail in Oklahoma as well as rescuing a waitress named Piper from her brutal, two-timing fianc\u00e9. There are odd things about Milton: his driver's license is out of date, he has a very strange gun, and he's being pursued by a man in a suit who carries FBI ID and calls himself the Accountant. Piper, who's lived a life on the sidelines, has to piece things together on the fly as they close in on King.", "tmdb_score_value": 5.3, "tmdb_score_count": 718, "imdb_score_value": 5.4, "imdb_score_count": 86960, "meta_score_value": 44.0, "meta_score_count": 21}
