However, today's journey is different because of Jacinta, who accompanies him as his passenger all the way to Buenos Aires. What's more, Rub\u00e9n finds out at the very moment that her little Anah\u00ed, who's 8 months old, travels with them. As kilometres go by, the relationship between Rub\u00e9n and Jacinta will grow. They will slowly sip into each other's soul. None of them talks much about their lives. None asks much either. It's a few word journey but it is not a silent one.", "tokens": ["rub\u00e9n", "lone", "truck", "driver", "take", "motorwai", "asunci\u00f3n", "paraguai", "bueno", "air", "argentina", "year", "carri", "wood", "howev", "todai", "journei", "differ", "jacinta", "accompani", "passeng", "wai", "bueno", "air", "what", "rub\u00e9n", "find", "moment", "littl", "anah\u00ed", "8", "month", "old", "travel", "as", "kilometr", "go", "relationship", "rub\u00e9n", "jacinta", "grow", "thei", "slowli", "sip", "soul", "none", "talk", "much", "live", "none", "ask", "much", "either", "it", "word", "journei", "silent", "on"], "tmdb_score_value": 6.1, "tmdb_score_count": 16, "imdb_score_value": 6.9, "imdb_score_count": 1934, "meta_score_value": 77.0, "meta_score_count": 6}
