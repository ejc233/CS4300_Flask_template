In China, workers gather outside the factory, exhorted by their team leader to produce more and make fewer errors. A woman assembles a circuit breaker, and women and children are seen picking through debris or playing in it. Burtynsky concludes with a visit to Shanghai, the world's fastest growing city, where wealth and poverty, high-rises and old neighborhoods are side by side.", "tokens": ["canadian", "artist", "edward", "burtynski", "address", "vast", "project", "modern", "civil", "devist", "impact", "earth", "scene", "immens", "chines", "dump", "ground", "bangladeshi", "shipyard", "manufactur", "plant", "stretch", "across", "beyond", "frame"], "tmdb_score_value": 7.4, "tmdb_score_count": 18, "imdb_score_value": 7.3, "imdb_score_count": 2550, "meta_score_value": 79.0, "meta_score_count": 16}
