Warren shoots his wife Helen's lover and his defense is that he thought he was shooting an intruder. She leaves him; the lawyer helps her get a job with a nutty, reclusive computer wizard who waves a pistol about, sometimes at Helen. Tennel, the computer geek's ex-assistant, lands a video-store job and is smitten by Annabel Lee, an aggressive street kid who likes complaining about men to her pistol-packing psychotic brother to set him off. In secret, Annabel starts an affair with the lawyer, who has both a pistol and a gay lover, who becomes jealous. He has a pistol too. A cool (and armed) cop stays on Warren's tail.", "tokens": ["handgun", "figur", "intertwin", "live", "nine", "peopl", "warren", "shoot", "wife", "helen", "lover", "defens", "thought", "shoot", "intrud", "she", "leav", "lawyer", "help", "get", "job", "nutti", "reclus", "comput", "wizard", "wave", "pistol", "sometim", "helen", "tennel", "comput", "geek", "ex", "assist", "land", "video", "store", "job", "smitten", "annabel", "lee", "aggress", "street", "kid", "like", "complain", "men", "pistol", "pack", "psychot", "brother", "set", "in", "secret", "annabel", "start", "affair", "lawyer", "pistol", "gai", "lover", "becom", "jealou", "he", "pistol", "a", "cool", "arm", "cop", "stai", "warren", "tail"], "tmdb_score_value": 5.4, "tmdb_score_count": 5, "imdb_score_value": 5.5, "imdb_score_count": 1646, "meta_score_value": 39.0, "meta_score_count": 10}
