Stuck in the mire of a disappointing season, the New York Knicks did what no other NBA team had thought about doing. They gave backup point guard Jeremy Lin an opportunity to prove himself. He took full advantage, scoring more points in his first five NBA starts than any other player in the modern era, and created a legitimate public frenzy in the process. Prior to this now-legendary run, Lin had faced adversity in his career at every turn. He wasn't offered a scholarship by any major university, nor was he drafted by any NBA team after a standout collegiate career at Harvard.", "tokens": ["in", "februari", "2012", "entir", "nation", "basketbal", "fan", "unexpectedli", "went", "linsan", "stuck", "mire", "disappoint", "season", "new", "york", "knick", "nba", "team", "thought", "thei", "gave", "backup", "point", "guard", "jeremi", "lin", "opportun", "prove", "he", "took", "full", "advantag", "score", "point", "first", "five", "nba", "start", "player", "modern", "era", "creat", "legitim", "public", "frenzi", "process", "prior", "legendari", "run", "lin", "face", "advers", "career", "everi", "turn", "he", "offer", "scholarship", "major", "univers", "draft", "nba", "team", "standout", "collegi", "career", "harvard"], "tmdb_score_value": 6.8, "tmdb_score_count": 15, "imdb_score_value": 7.4, "imdb_score_count": 1799, "meta_score_value": 52.0, "meta_score_count": 13}
