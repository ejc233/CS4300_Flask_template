Joe, General Abernathy (or Hawk) is on the trail of the thieves: an evil organization called \"Cobra\". While Duke and Ripcord train to join the Joes, McCullen (\"Destro\") is secretly working for Cobra and plotting to recapture his metal-eating \"Nanomite\" warheads. Duke and Ripcord (with help from Heavy Duty, Snake Eyes, and the rest of the Joes) must prove that they are Real American Heroes -- by stopping the launch of these warheads before Cobra uses them to take over the world.", "tmdb_score_value": 5.6, "tmdb_score_count": 2304, "imdb_score_value": 5.8, "imdb_score_count": 185607, "meta_score_value": 32.0, "meta_score_count": 25}
