She developed an interest in cattle early in life while spending time at her Aunt and Uncle's ranch. She did not speak until age four and had difficulty right through high school, mostly in dealing with people. Her mother was very supportive as were some of her teachers. She is noted for creating her \"hug box\", widely recognized today as a way of relieving stress in autistic children, and her humane design for the treatment of cattle in processing plants, which have been the subject of several books and won an award from PETA. Today, she is a professor at Colorado State University and well-known speaker on autism and animal handling.", "tmdb_score_value": 7.8, "tmdb_score_count": 123, "imdb_score_value": 8.3, "imdb_score_count": 22869, "meta_score_value": 0.0, "meta_score_count": 0}
