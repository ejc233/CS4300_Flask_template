In addition to these irritating surface details, there is also his parent's cherished mechanisms of manipulation and guilt. Confused by this love/hate relationship that obsesses him more and more each day, Hubert drifts through the mysteries of adolescence - artistic discoveries, illicit experiences, the opening-up to friendship, and ostracism. The turbulent relationship between mother and son unfolds with a compelling combination of savage fury and melting affection. The stunning, semi-autobiographical directing debut of 20-year-old actor Xavier Dolan.", "tmdb_score_value": 7.7, "tmdb_score_count": 406, "imdb_score_value": 7.5, "imdb_score_count": 22628, "meta_score_value": 77.0, "meta_score_count": 9}
