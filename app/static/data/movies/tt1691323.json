Finding the human species strange and repellent, she keeps her distance from it. Instead she observes it through the songs of Alan Vega's Suicide, the mammal documentaries of Sir David Attenborough, and the sexual education lesson she receives from her only friend, Bella. A stranger comes to town and challenges her to a foosball duel, on her own table. Her father meanwhile is preparing for his exit from the 20th century, which he considers to be 'overrated'. Caught between the two men and her collaborator Bella, Marina investigates the wondrous mystery of the human fauna.", "tokens": ["marina", "23", "grow", "architect", "father", "prototyp", "factori", "town", "sea", "find", "human", "speci", "strang", "repel", "keep", "distanc", "instead", "stubbornli", "observ", "song", "suicid", "mammal", "documentari", "sir", "david", "attenborough", "ed", "lesson", "receiv", "friend", "bella"], "tmdb_score_value": 5.7, "tmdb_score_count": 41, "imdb_score_value": 6.2, "imdb_score_count": 5041, "meta_score_value": 73.0, "meta_score_count": 13}
