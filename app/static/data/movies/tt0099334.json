His one curse in his life, he feels, is his large nose and although it may have been a forming influence in his rapier-sharp wit, he believes that Roxane will reject him. He resorts to writing letters to her on behalf of one of his cadets, Christian, who is also in love with Roxane but just doesn't know how to tell her. She falls for the poetic charm of the letters but believes that they were written by Christian.", "tmdb_score_value": 7.0, "tmdb_score_count": 183, "imdb_score_value": 7.6, "imdb_score_count": 19682, "meta_score_value": 0.0, "meta_score_count": 0}
