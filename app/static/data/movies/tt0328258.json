He taught his quiet, nerdy childhood friend \"Smile\" Tsukimoto. Smile frustrates his coach and rivals, who recognize his talent for the game since it is just a game to him. To teach him, his high-school coach learns that coaching is more than just training the students to be good ping-pong players. Ironically, as Smile begins to develop his game, Peco undergoes a severe crisis after his defeat by rival players and is unable to play well until he rediscovers the original reasons why he plays ping-pong.", "tokens": ["the", "film", "trace", "growth", "friendship", "two", "differ", "high", "school", "ping", "pong", "player", "peco", "hoshino", "brash", "arrog", "player", "determin", "turn", "pro", "he", "taught", "quiet", "nerdi", "childhood", "friend", "smile", "tsukimoto", "smile", "frustrat", "coach", "rival", "recogn", "talent", "game", "sinc", "game", "to", "teach", "high", "school", "coach", "learn", "coach", "train", "student", "good", "ping", "pong", "player", "iron", "smile", "begin", "develop", "game", "peco", "undergo", "sever", "crisi", "defeat", "rival", "player", "unabl", "plai", "well", "rediscov", "origin", "reason", "plai", "ping", "pong"], "tmdb_score_value": 6.8, "tmdb_score_count": 31, "imdb_score_value": 7.2, "imdb_score_count": 2957, "meta_score_value": 59.0, "meta_score_count": 8}
