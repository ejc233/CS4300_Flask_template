She catches John Tucker (Jesse Metcalfe) dating three different girls at once: Carrie - the smart girl, Heather - the cheerleader, and Beth - the activist slut; none of them are aware that they are not the only girl in John's heart. Kate, having been raised by a single mother, has seen the pain caused by playboys like John Tucker, and she won't stand idly by. Together with the three jilted ex-girlfriends, they hatch a plan to teach John a lesson. Things rarely go as planned, especially when Kate starts to think that she might be falling for John herself.", "tmdb_score_value": 5.9, "tmdb_score_count": 501, "imdb_score_value": 5.8, "imdb_score_count": 72699, "meta_score_value": 41.0, "meta_score_count": 27}
