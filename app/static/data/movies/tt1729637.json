In a bar, Ranjan's brother attacks Divya and is killed by Lovely - setting into motion a chain of events that will pit Lovely not only against the enraged Mhatre brothers but also against Sartaj himself, who believes that Lovely is attempting to elope with his daughter.", "tmdb_score_value": 5.1, "tmdb_score_count": 46, "imdb_score_value": 4.6, "imdb_score_count": 18954, "meta_score_value": 41.0, "meta_score_count": 5}
