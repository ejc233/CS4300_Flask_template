But when Dale becomes the only witness to a murder by a crooked cop and the city's most dangerous drug lord, he panics and dumps his roach of Pineapple Express at the scene. Dale now has another reason to visit Saul: to find out if the weed is so rare that it can be traced back to him--and it is. As Dale and Saul run for their lives, they quickly discover that they're not suffering from weed-fueled paranoia: incredibly, the bad guys really are hot on their trail and trying to figure out the fastest way to kill them both. All aboard the Pineapple Express.", "tmdb_score_value": 6.6, "tmdb_score_count": 1442, "imdb_score_value": 7.0, "imdb_score_count": 279505, "meta_score_value": 64.0, "meta_score_count": 37}
