Michael had been ousted from his home town due to his gambling indiscretions and had left his wife to deal with the mess he created. He now must reassimilate back into the town, renew his relationships with his family and friends (and enemies) and, most of all, seek out his ex-wife to woo her again. In the process, he obtains a job working with his mother's new husband as an armored car driver. He almost seems the perfect prodigal son as he finds his niche back in the community and his way back into his ex's heart. His troubles surmount when he and his wife are caught in the act by her hoodlum boyfriend/fianc\u00e9. To get out of this predicament, Michael must concoct a plan to heist of a payroll being carried by his armored car company.", "tokens": ["michael", "chamber", "return", "home", "celebr", "mother", "marriag", "michael", "oust", "home", "town", "due", "gambl", "indiscret", "left", "wife", "deal", "mess", "creat", "he", "must", "reassimil", "back", "town", "renew", "relationship", "famili", "friend", "enemi", "seek", "ex", "wife", "woo", "in", "process", "obtain", "job", "work", "mother", "new", "husband", "armor", "car", "driver", "he", "almost", "seem", "perfect", "prodig", "son", "find", "nich", "back", "commun", "wai", "back", "ex", "heart", "hi", "troubl", "surmount", "wife", "caught", "act", "hoodlum", "boyfriend/fianc\u00e9", "to", "get", "predica", "michael", "must", "concoct", "plan", "heist", "payrol", "carri", "armor", "car", "compani"], "tmdb_score_value": 5.6, "tmdb_score_count": 20, "imdb_score_value": 6.2, "imdb_score_count": 2783, "meta_score_value": 69.0, "meta_score_count": 11}
