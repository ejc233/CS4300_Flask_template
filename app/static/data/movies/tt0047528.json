Zampano is a traveling showman who exhibits feats of strength by breaking a chain wrapped around his chest. He performs in village squares and then passes the hat for whatever the normally small crowd is prepared to give. He teaches Gelsomina a drum roll as part of his introduction. He doesn't treat her well and when she tries to run away, he beats her. They eventually join a small traveling circus where they meet a tight-rope walker who convinces Gelsomina to question her choices.", "tmdb_score_value": 7.7, "tmdb_score_count": 254, "imdb_score_value": 8.1, "imdb_score_count": 50561, "meta_score_value": 0.0, "meta_score_count": 0}
