That especially shows during his peak artistic years in the 1960s, as his inner demons and obsessions trying to please his abusive father drive him to a mental breakdown that would plague him for years. In the 1980s, with Brian barely functional under the domination of the unscrupulous Dr. Landy, Brian meets and falls in love with Melinda Ledbetter. As their relationship grows, she observes Brian's crippling subservience to the abusive psychotherapist with growing alarm. Ultimately, she must take action with a love willing to stand up to oppression she cannot ignore.", "tmdb_score_value": 7.3, "tmdb_score_count": 299, "imdb_score_value": 7.4, "imdb_score_count": 29993, "meta_score_value": 80.0, "meta_score_count": 40}
