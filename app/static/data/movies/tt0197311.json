They are scavengers rousted out of their shanty town that morning by Afrikaners. They've walked all day carrying what they possess. She may be alcoholic, he's prone to anger: earlier that day, he beat her for something she didn't do. Over the next 12 or 15 hours, their relationship goes through a storm, partly as each remembers earlier events both happy and tragic, and because Lena, over Boesman's objections, takes into their camp an elderly Xhosa tribesman, a Black. Boesman is cruel to the old man, she is kind, and as rain heads toward them, a confrontation develops.", "tokens": ["on", "cold", "afternoon", "apartheid", "era", "ag", "brown", "coupl", "arriv", "swartkop", "mud", "flat", "near", "cape", "town", "thei", "scaveng", "roust", "shanti", "town", "morn", "afrikan", "thei", "walk", "dai", "carri", "possess", "she", "mai", "alcohol", "prone", "anger", "earlier", "dai", "beat", "someth", "over", "next", "12", "15", "hour", "relationship", "goe", "storm", "partli", "rememb", "earlier", "event", "happi", "tragic", "lena", "boesman", "object", "take", "camp", "elderli", "xhosa", "tribesman", "black", "boesman", "cruel", "old", "man", "kind", "rain", "head", "toward", "confront", "develop"], "tmdb_score_value": 0.0, "tmdb_score_count": 0, "imdb_score_value": 5.9, "imdb_score_count": 199, "meta_score_value": 59.0, "meta_score_count": 11}
