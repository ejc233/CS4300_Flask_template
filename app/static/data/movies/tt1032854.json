Archival footage, news articles, and photographs mix with contemporary interviews of Verg\u00e8s, friends, associates, and historians. Connections with Nazis are explored, as well as Verg\u00e8s's marriage to Djamila Bouhared, his courtroom methods, his disappearance from 1970 to 1978, and the roots of his radicalism. Throughout, Verg\u00e8s remains playful and charming, with a soup\u00e7on of arrogance. The film suggests Verg\u00e8s's anti-colonial nature is at his center.", "tokens": ["an", "examin", "career", "jacqu", "verg\u00e8", "1925", "attornei", "member", "algeria", "fln", "palestin", "fplp", "khmer", "roug", "carlo", "associ", "klau", "barbi", "revolutionari", "outcast", "archiv", "footag", "new", "articl", "photograph", "mix", "contemporari", "interview", "verg\u00e8", "friend", "associ", "historian", "connect", "nazi", "explor", "well", "verg\u00e8", "marriag", "djamila", "bouhar", "courtroom", "method", "disappear", "1970", "1978", "root", "radic", "throughout", "verg\u00e8", "remain", "play", "charm", "soup\u00e7on", "arrog", "the", "film", "suggest", "verg\u00e8", "anti", "coloni", "natur", "center"], "tmdb_score_value": 6.5, "tmdb_score_count": 13, "imdb_score_value": 7.2, "imdb_score_count": 1368, "meta_score_value": 75.0, "meta_score_count": 17}
