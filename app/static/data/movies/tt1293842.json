In a Hoosier town, boys' basketball is king. Bill is a former athlete and high-school coach who drinks too much, rarely sees his daughter from an old marriage, and busses tables at a local cafe. A friend who's now a principal offers him a job coaching girls; Bill takes it without much spirit. Six come to practice; one has a broken foot. They're awful in their first game, and Bill has to figure out, with help from Donna, the school's burly bus driver, if he actually can coach girls. They respond, and Bill suddenly has a family of sorts, just as his own relationship with his daughter worsens. With a winning season in reach, will Bill blow this chance?", "tokens": ["onli", "connect", "in", "hoosier", "town", "boi", "basketbal", "king", "bill", "former", "athlet", "high", "school", "coach", "drink", "much", "rare", "see", "daughter", "old", "marriag", "buss", "tabl", "local", "cafe", "a", "friend", "princip", "offer", "job", "coach", "girl", "bill", "take", "without", "much", "spirit", "six", "come", "practic", "on", "broken", "foot", "thei", "aw", "first", "game", "bill", "figur", "help", "donna", "school", "burli", "bu", "driver", "actual", "coach", "girl", "thei", "respond", "bill", "suddenli", "famili", "sort", "relationship", "daughter", "worsen", "with", "win", "season", "reach", "bill", "blow", "chanc"], "tmdb_score_value": 6.4, "tmdb_score_count": 54, "imdb_score_value": 6.6, "imdb_score_count": 5362, "meta_score_value": 53.0, "meta_score_count": 8}
