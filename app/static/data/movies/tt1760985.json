Paul has just moved into an apartment with his pragmatic girlfriend, Jen, and is struggling to complete his dissertation before embarking on a career in academia. There's just one snag: as Paul is unpacking his belongings, he discovers that something has been left behind. A seemingly inconsequential object, but one Paul feels is of great importance to his dissertation and, therefore, to his future: a battered, personally annotated hardcover copy of 'Little Dorrit' by Charles Dickens. He will have to retrieve it from his former roommate - the obstinate Nancy. As he becomes increasingly consumed with the retrieval of 'Little Dorrit', Paul's relationship and career unravel.", "tokens": ["nanci", "pleas", "tell", "stori", "paul", "brawlei", "gift", "phd", "candid", "yale", "univers", "paul", "move", "apart", "pragmat", "girlfriend", "jen", "struggl", "complet", "dissert", "embark", "career", "academia", "there", "on", "snag", "paul", "unpack", "belong", "discov", "someth", "left", "behind", "a", "seemingli", "inconsequenti", "object", "on", "paul", "feel", "great", "import", "dissert", "therefor", "futur", "batter", "person", "annot", "hardcov", "copi", "littl", "dorrit", "charl", "dicken", "he", "retriev", "former", "roommat", "obstin", "nanci", "as", "becom", "increasingli", "consum", "retriev", "littl", "dorrit", "paul", "relationship", "career", "unravel"], "tmdb_score_value": 6.1, "tmdb_score_count": 4, "imdb_score_value": 5.5, "imdb_score_count": 189, "meta_score_value": 76.0, "meta_score_count": 5}
