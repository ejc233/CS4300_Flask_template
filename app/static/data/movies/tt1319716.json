Raj does so and meets with his childhood girlfriend, Roopi Sethi, who lives with her widowed mother and brother, Jazz. Both continue to meet and an unsuspecting Raj will be taken by surprise when his superiors consider Roopi as a suspect in these homicides as she knew all the deceased victims. Before they could take any further steps, a fifth homicide occurs - that of Mrs. Goldstein. Again this victim is also known to Roopi, but in order to arrest her, they must find evidence and also a motive.", "tokens": ["southal", "polic", "baffl", "four", "success", "homicid", "east", "indian", "request", "detect", "raj", "murthi", "mingl", "local", "commun", "find", "behind", "murder", "raj", "meet", "childhood", "girlfriend", "roopi", "sethi", "live", "widow", "mother", "brother", "jazz", "both", "continu", "meet", "unsuspect", "raj", "taken", "surpris", "superior", "consid", "roopi", "suspect", "homicid", "knew", "deceas", "victim", "befor", "could", "take", "step", "fifth", "homicid", "occur", "mr", "goldstein", "again", "victim", "also", "known", "roopi", "order", "arrest", "must", "find", "evid", "also", "motiv"], "tmdb_score_value": 4.5, "tmdb_score_count": 11, "imdb_score_value": 5.4, "imdb_score_count": 1323, "meta_score_value": 40.0, "meta_score_count": 7}
