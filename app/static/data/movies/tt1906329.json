She gets on well with her father but is frequently separated from him for months on end when he goes to work in Canada. Her relationship with her mother is easy-going and she takes care of most things around the house. She tunes into her sexuality and her not so 'stable' family dynamics. She develops a relationship with her best friend Kenny and starts to realize that her parents' marriage is not as solid as she had previously imagined. She notices that her father's extended stays away from the family are not typical, and that her mother does not pine for her father as much as she herself does.", "tokens": ["sixteen", "year", "old", "luci", "tomboi", "she", "get", "well", "father", "frequent", "separ", "month", "end", "goe", "work", "canada", "her", "relationship", "mother", "easi", "go", "take", "care", "thing", "around", "hous", "she", "tune", "sexual", "stabl", "famili", "dynam", "she", "develop", "relationship", "best", "friend", "kenni", "start", "realiz", "parent", "marriag", "solid", "previous", "imagin", "she", "notic", "father", "extend", "stai", "awai", "famili", "typic", "mother", "pine", "father", "much"], "tmdb_score_value": 5.3, "tmdb_score_count": 49, "imdb_score_value": 5.9, "imdb_score_count": 4700, "meta_score_value": 28.0, "meta_score_count": 6}
