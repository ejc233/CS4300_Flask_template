Every time he focuses his camera on someone, the same woman appears in his viewfinder - an image he cannot bear. When his brother Aram, whom he has not seen or spoke to for years, unexpectedly phones him and asks him to come to their parental home because their mother is severely ill and may not have long to live, he panics. The thought of a confrontation with the area where he grew up and the renewed encounter with his family makes him feel nervous. Nevertheless, that evening he leaves for AmnesiA: the estate of his parents, the spot where he spent his youth.", "tokens": ["alex", "28", "year", "old", "photograph", "longer", "abl", "photograph", "peopl", "mysteri", "reason", "everi", "time", "focus", "camera", "someon", "woman", "appear", "viewfind", "imag", "cannot", "bear", "when", "brother", "aram", "seen", "spoke", "year", "unexpectedli", "phone", "ask", "come", "parent", "home", "mother", "sever", "ill", "mai", "long", "live", "panic", "the", "thought", "confront", "area", "grew", "renew", "encount", "famili", "make", "feel", "nervou", "nevertheless", "even", "leav", "amnesia", "estat", "parent", "spot", "spent", "youth"], "tmdb_score_value": 2.0, "tmdb_score_count": 1, "imdb_score_value": 6.7, "imdb_score_count": 419, "meta_score_value": 57.0, "meta_score_count": 5}
