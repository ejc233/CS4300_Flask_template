Under those circumstances, Bryce would do anything to prove his worth once again, and as a result, it won't be long before he accepts an offer from Interpol to escort the renowned international assassin Darius Kincaid from Manchester to the Hague. The task seems simple: Bryce only needs to transport the contract killer from point A to point B, nevertheless, Kincaid, as the only one with the guts and enough hard evidence to testify against a tyrannical Belarusian dictator, is an obvious target, while the trip to the Netherlands is long and hazardous. Without a doubt, this is a race against the clock as the mismatched duo will have to put aside their grudges, in a non-stop concerto for bullets.", "tmdb_score_value": 6.7, "tmdb_score_count": 1832, "imdb_score_value": 6.9, "imdb_score_count": 125120, "meta_score_value": 47.0, "meta_score_count": 42}
