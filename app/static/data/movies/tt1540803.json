They drop in on Ashton Kutcher to see if he'll co-star, ask Jon Favreau to direct, and seek advice from Tom Arnold (because he was in \"True Lies\"). The road to a green light is rough, full of stops and cul-de-sacs. Along the way there's a front-yard wrestling match with Bradley Cooper and David Koechner, back stories on other Shepard/Tuck ventures, and a rupture in a life-long friendship. Can Dax get his kung-fu movie made in spite of rejection?", "tokens": ["brother", "justic", "follow", "actor", "dax", "shepard", "tri", "radic", "chang", "direct", "career", "\u00a0known", "comedian", "dax", "met", "strong", "opposit", "try", "secur", "financ", "martial", "art", "film", "\u00a0with", "maniac", "convict", "take", "bizarr", "path", "becom", "increasingli", "nonsensical\u00a0and", "destruct", "exploit", "everi", "relationship", "along", "wai"], "tmdb_score_value": 5.1, "tmdb_score_count": 5, "imdb_score_value": 4.6, "imdb_score_count": 458, "meta_score_value": 22.0, "meta_score_count": 7}
