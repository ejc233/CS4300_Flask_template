She rents a riverside cabin in upstate New York to work on her novel, attracting the attention of a number of rowdy male locals. They catch Jennifer one day and strip her naked for the village idiot (Matthew) and rape her. Jennifer is later attacked and raped a further two times by the four degenerates, and her novel is also destroyed. But Jennifer recovers, and in her now-twisted, psychotic state, she begins to seek revenge on the men.", "tmdb_score_value": 5.8, "tmdb_score_count": 182, "imdb_score_value": 5.7, "imdb_score_count": 22303, "meta_score_value": 19.0, "meta_score_count": 6}
