From then on, Whangara chiefs, always the first-born, always male, have been considered Paikea's direct descendants. Pai, an 11-year-old girl in a patriarchal New Zealand tribe, believes she is destined to be the new chief. But her grandfather Koro is bound by tradition to pick a male leader. Pai loves Koro more than anyone in the world, but she must fight him and a thousand years of tradition to fulfill her destiny.", "tmdb_score_value": 7.2, "tmdb_score_count": 141, "imdb_score_value": 7.6, "imdb_score_count": 36436, "meta_score_value": 80.0, "meta_score_count": 31}
