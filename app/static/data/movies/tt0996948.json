One night, a rich young businessman makes an advance on him during one of his driving jobs. They meet again the next day: it is during a round of redundancy cuts at the factory where Sumin refuses an attempt by a man (who is in fact the boss' son Jaemin) to save his job. Eventually, Sumin is seduced into working as a prostitute in an up-market boy-brothel as Jaemin's obsession with him grows, leaving Jaemin helpless in the face of his overwhelming desire. This is a film of bold sexuality, where unexpected passion, desire and misunderstandings wreak havoc of an operatic intensity.", "tokens": ["sumin", "orphan", "try", "balanc", "work", "factori", "studi", "art", "colleg", "even", "job", "on", "night", "rich", "young", "businessman", "make", "advanc", "on", "drive", "job", "thei", "meet", "next", "dai", "round", "redund", "cut", "factori", "sumin", "refus", "attempt", "man", "fact", "boss", "son", "jaemin", "save", "job", "eventu", "sumin", "seduc", "work", "prostitut", "market", "boi", "brothel", "jaemin", "obsess", "grow", "leav", "jaemin", "helpless", "face", "overwhelm", "desir", "thi", "film", "bold", "sexual", "unexpect", "passion", "desir", "misunderstand", "wreak", "havoc", "operat", "intens"], "tmdb_score_value": 6.0, "tmdb_score_count": 10, "imdb_score_value": 6.6, "imdb_score_count": 1580, "meta_score_value": 48.0, "meta_score_count": 5}
