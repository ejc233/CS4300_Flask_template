At first he thinks he's hit the jackpot-fame and fortune are his for the taking. That all changes, however, when he meets three witches, Theodora , Evanora , and Glinda , who are not convinced he is the great wizard everyone's been expecting. Reluctantly drawn into the epic problems facing the Land of Oz and its inhabitants, Oscar must find out who is good and who is evil before it is too late. Putting his magical arts to use through illusion, ingenuity-and even a bit of wizardry-Oscar transforms himself not only into the great and powerful Wizard of Oz but into a better man as well.", "tmdb_score_value": 5.7, "tmdb_score_count": 4000, "imdb_score_value": 6.3, "imdb_score_count": 186673, "meta_score_value": 44.0, "meta_score_count": 42}
