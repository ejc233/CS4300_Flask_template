The Lottery follows four of these families from Harlem and the Bronx who have entered their children in a charter school lottery. Out of thousands of hopefuls, only a small minority will win the chance of a better future. The Lottery uncovers a ferocious debate surrounding the education reform movement. Interviews with politicians and educators explain not only the crisis in public education, but also why it is fixable. A call to action to avert a catastrophe in the education of American children, The Lottery makes the case that any child can succeed.", "tokens": ["in", "countri", "58%", "african", "american", "4th", "grader", "function", "illiter", "the", "lotteri", "uncov", "failur", "tradit", "public", "school", "system", "reveal", "hundr", "thousand", "parent", "attempt", "flee", "system", "everi", "year", "the", "lotteri", "follow", "four", "famili", "harlem", "bronx", "enter", "children", "charter", "school", "lotteri", "out", "thousand", "hope", "small", "minor", "win", "chanc", "better", "futur", "the", "lotteri", "uncov", "feroci", "debat", "surround", "educ", "reform", "movement", "interview", "politician", "educ", "explain", "crisi", "public", "educ", "also", "fixabl", "a", "call", "action", "avert", "catastroph", "educ", "american", "children", "the", "lotteri", "make", "case", "child", "succe"], "tmdb_score_value": 5.0, "tmdb_score_count": 1, "imdb_score_value": 7.0, "imdb_score_count": 539, "meta_score_value": 72.0, "meta_score_count": 9}
