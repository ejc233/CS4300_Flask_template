He also guesses she has talent and invites her to be his pupil and share his bed. He's Alfred Stieglitz, she's Georgia O'Keefe, and he calls her his Guinevere. When she realizes she's the latest Guinevere in a string of ingenues, she bolts, only to return, sick of her family. She's blossoming, reading, learning, but hasn't yet taken her first photograph when he tells her they're going to L.A., broke, him drinking too much, to sell some photographs. On the trip, she finally snaps the shutter; so does her awe and dependence.", "tokens": ["conni", "ag", "bohemian", "photograph", "meet", "mousi", "harper", "head", "harvard", "law", "high", "power", "san", "francisco", "famili", "immedi", "see", "beauti", "he", "also", "guess", "talent", "invit", "pupil", "share", "bed", "he", "alfr", "stieglitz", "georgia", "o", "keef", "call", "guinever", "when", "realiz", "latest", "guinever", "string", "ingenu", "bolt", "return", "sick", "famili", "she", "blossom", "read", "learn", "yet", "taken", "first", "photograph", "tell", "go", "l", "a", "broke", "drink", "much", "sell", "photograph", "on", "trip", "final", "snap", "shutter", "aw", "depend"], "tmdb_score_value": 5.9, "tmdb_score_count": 13, "imdb_score_value": 6.0, "imdb_score_count": 2255, "meta_score_value": 68.0, "meta_score_count": 25}
