I did: forced-labor camps, beatings, hunger, cannibalism, homosexuality... it uncovered his demons. Some things were familiar - others seemed weird, hallucinatory, nightmarish. I tried deciphering them, following the memoir's path. I made half the journey alone. I forced the second half on my siblings, who didn't want to participate, even while crawling around tunnels and enchanted forests. This isn't a film about the holocaust, because we spent most of our time laughing... it's about a rare intimacy and bond that replaced pain with bitter-sweet humor.", "tokens": ["my", "sibl", "refus", "open", "dad", "memoir", "death", "contain", "secret", "long", "lock", "awai", "i", "forc", "labor", "camp", "beat", "hunger", "cannib", "homosexu", "uncov", "demon", "some", "thing", "familiar", "other", "seem", "weird", "hallucinatori", "nightmarish", "i", "tri", "deciph", "follow", "memoir", "path", "i", "made", "half", "journei", "alon", "i", "forc", "second", "half", "sibl", "want", "particip", "even", "crawl", "around", "tunnel", "enchant", "forest", "thi", "film", "holocaust", "spent", "time", "laugh", "rare", "intimaci", "bond", "replac", "pain", "bitter", "sweet", "humor"], "tmdb_score_value": 0.0, "tmdb_score_count": 0, "imdb_score_value": 6.8, "imdb_score_count": 46, "meta_score_value": 52.0, "meta_score_count": 5}
