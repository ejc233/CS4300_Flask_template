His desires in life conflict with both his family's traditional values, and the usual Indian way of assimilating into America by becoming a doctor or engineer. As graduation approaches, he has an opportunity to be nationally recognized for his music which will simplify telling his father the truth. Value conflicts are explored as the rationale behind internal racism and dating objectives are also explored.", "tokens": ["sureel", "first", "gener", "indian", "american", "colleg", "graduat", "senior", "music", "major", "control", "father", "still", "believ", "pre", "med", "hi", "desir", "life", "conflict", "famili", "tradit", "valu", "usual", "indian", "wai", "assimil", "america", "becom", "doctor", "engin", "as", "graduat", "approach", "opportun", "nation", "recogn", "music", "simplifi", "tell", "father", "truth", "valu", "conflict", "explor", "rational", "behind", "intern", "racism", "date", "object", "also", "explor"], "tmdb_score_value": 0.0, "tmdb_score_count": 0, "imdb_score_value": 6.3, "imdb_score_count": 305, "meta_score_value": 46.0, "meta_score_count": 12}
