Unfortunately, his father was a two-bit crook who spent most of his life in jail. Without a family of his own, Ned falls in with the Aryan Brotherhood. Soon after, Ned is placed in a mental hospital where he is mesmerized by a young black girl who believes Adolf Hitler was reincarnated in her. What follows is a gritty character study and poignant love story of two people brought together by a seemingly impossible connection. As a result of that connection, they both find that there is more to a person than what is on the surface.", "tokens": ["like", "kid", "ned", "idol", "father", "dream", "follow", "footstep", "unfortun", "father", "two", "bit", "crook", "spent", "life", "jail", "without", "famili", "ned", "fall", "aryan", "brotherhood", "soon", "ned", "place", "mental", "hospit", "mesmer", "young", "black", "girl", "believ", "adolf", "hitler", "reincarn", "what", "follow", "gritti", "charact", "studi", "poignant", "love", "stori", "two", "peopl", "brought", "togeth", "seemingli", "imposs", "connect", "as", "result", "connect", "find", "person", "surfac"], "tmdb_score_value": 5.6, "tmdb_score_count": 5, "imdb_score_value": 7.2, "imdb_score_count": 1436, "meta_score_value": 71.0, "meta_score_count": 4}
