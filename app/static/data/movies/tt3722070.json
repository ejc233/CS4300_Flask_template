She had played Chopin in a promenade concert, tried to become a nun, was committed to an institution by her brother, escaped, had an accident when her van was hit by a motorcyclist for which she believed herself to blame, and thereafter lived in fear of arrest.", "tokens": ["the", "ladi", "van", "tell", "true", "stori", "alan", "bennett", "strain", "friendship", "miss", "mari", "shepherd", "eccentr", "homeless", "woman", "bennett", "befriend", "1970", "allow", "temporarili", "park", "bedford", "van", "drivewai", "camden", "home", "she", "stai", "15", "year", "as", "stori", "develop", "bennett", "learn", "miss", "shepherd", "realli", "margaret", "fairchild", "di", "1989", "former", "gift", "pupil", "pianist", "alfr", "cortot", "she", "plai", "chopin", "promenad", "concert", "tri", "becom", "nun", "commit", "institut", "brother", "escap", "accid", "van", "hit", "motorcyclist", "believ", "blame", "thereaft", "live", "fear", "arrest"], "tmdb_score_value": 6.1, "tmdb_score_count": 273, "imdb_score_value": 6.7, "imdb_score_count": 20081, "meta_score_value": 70.0, "meta_score_count": 30}
