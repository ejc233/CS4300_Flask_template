Every seven years, Michael Apted re-interviews those willing (two declined this time). At 42, careers are stuck or flourishing; marriages are strong, shaky, or over (and Bruce recently married for the first time). They're dealing with parents' dying, and children coming-of-age. One is a single mom with young sons. One is remarried, but how are the five children from his first marriage? Lyn and Jackie face health problems with down-to-earth lucidity. Neil, on the margin at 28 and 35, has a glorious story of friendship at 42.", "tokens": ["in", "1964", "film", "crew", "interview", "seven", "year", "old", "english", "kid", "five", "six", "privileg", "yorkshir", "farm", "lad", "east", "end", "girl", "boi", "children", "home", "everi", "seven", "year", "michael", "apt", "interview", "will", "two", "declin", "time", "at", "42", "career", "stuck", "flourish", "marriag", "strong", "shaki", "bruce", "recent", "marri", "first", "time", "thei", "deal", "parent", "dy", "children", "come", "ag", "on", "singl", "mom", "young", "son", "on", "remarri", "five", "children", "first", "marriag", "lyn", "jacki", "face", "health", "problem", "earth", "lucid", "neil", "margin", "28", "35", "gloriou", "stori", "friendship", "42"], "tmdb_score_value": 6.9, "tmdb_score_count": 16, "imdb_score_value": 8.3, "imdb_score_count": 2004, "meta_score_value": 86.0, "meta_score_count": 22}
