Sisters Jin and Bin, ages 6 and 3, live with their mother. Jin likes school and does well. One day, their mother leaves the girls with their father's sister, a woman they do not know. The mother seeks a reconciliation with their father. She leaves them a plastic piggy bank, promising to return when the bank is full. The girls scrub and clean for their aunt, a tippler who's often cranky and complaining. She gives them a few coins for their work. They earn more money catching, grilling, and selling grasshoppers. They miss their mother. The bank fills. They watch for her from a mound of dirt. Will she return? Will stoic faces give way to a smile?", "tokens": ["what", "natur", "childhood", "resili", "sister", "jin", "bin", "ag", "6", "3", "live", "mother", "jin", "like", "school", "well", "on", "dai", "mother", "leav", "girl", "father", "sister", "woman", "know", "the", "mother", "seek", "reconcili", "father", "she", "leav", "plastic", "piggi", "bank", "promis", "return", "bank", "full", "the", "girl", "scrub", "clean", "aunt", "tippler", "often", "cranki", "complain", "she", "give", "coin", "work", "thei", "earn", "monei", "catch", "grill", "sell", "grasshopp", "thei", "miss", "mother", "the", "bank", "fill", "thei", "watch", "mound", "dirt", "will", "return", "will", "stoic", "face", "give", "wai", "smile"], "tmdb_score_value": 6.8, "tmdb_score_count": 13, "imdb_score_value": 7.2, "imdb_score_count": 1520, "meta_score_value": 75.0, "meta_score_count": 14}
