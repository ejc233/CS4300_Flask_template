His mother has just died. His father, a building contractor, can barely keep tabs on his young girlfriend, let alone his own son. Thusly, the teen must navigate his adolescence virtually unsupervised. Floating towards an ill-behaved existence, Howie and his crowd begin robbing houses in the middle-class neighborhoods off the Long Island Expressway. Together, he and his best friend Gary break into a place belonging to an old guy named Big John, a local man who is a respected pillar of the community. When Big John fingers Gary for the crime, Howie learns that his pal has been leading a secret, dangerous but also alluring double life. Subsequently, we also discover that Big John has secrets of his own.", "tokens": ["fifteen", "year", "old", "howi", "lose", "everyth", "everyon", "space", "singl", "week", "end", "find", "process", "hi", "mother", "di", "hi", "father", "build", "contractor", "bare", "keep", "tab", "young", "girlfriend", "let", "alon", "son", "thusli", "teen", "must", "navig", "adolesc", "virtual", "unsupervis", "float", "toward", "ill", "behav", "exist", "howi", "crowd", "begin", "rob", "hous", "middl", "class", "neighborhood", "long", "island", "expresswai", "togeth", "best", "friend", "gari", "break", "place", "belong", "old", "gui", "name", "big", "john", "local", "man", "respect", "pillar", "commun", "when", "big", "john", "finger", "gari", "crime", "howi", "learn", "pal", "lead", "secret", "danger", "also", "allur", "doubl", "life", "subsequ", "also", "discov", "big", "john", "secret"], "tmdb_score_value": 6.7, "tmdb_score_count": 38, "imdb_score_value": 7.2, "imdb_score_count": 8977, "meta_score_value": 73.0, "meta_score_count": 25}
