Eventually striking out on his own, Cecil becomes a hotel valet of such efficiency and discreteness in the 1950s that he becomes a butler in the White House itself. There, Cecil would serve numerous US Presidents over the decades as a passive witness of history with the American Civil Rights Movement gaining momentum even as his family has troubles of its own. As his wife, Gloria, struggles with her addictions and his defiant eldest son, Louis, strives for a just world, Cecil must decide whether he should take action in his own way.", "tmdb_score_value": 7.2, "tmdb_score_count": 1382, "imdb_score_value": 7.2, "imdb_score_count": 97429, "meta_score_value": 66.0, "meta_score_count": 47}
