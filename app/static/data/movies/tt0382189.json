Adding volatility is Mona's older brother Phil, who has renounced his criminal past for religious fervor - which he tries to impose upon his sister. Mona, however, is experiencing her own rapture. \"We must never be parted,\" Tamsin intones to Mona but can Mona completely trust her?", "tmdb_score_value": 6.0, "tmdb_score_count": 80, "imdb_score_value": 6.8, "imdb_score_count": 17556, "meta_score_value": 82.0, "meta_score_count": 31}
