Her psychiatrist, Jonathan Banks, after conferring with her previous doctor, eventually prescribes an experimental new medication called Ablixa. The plot thickens when the side effects of the drug lead to Emily killing her husband in a \"sleepwalking\" state. With Emily plea-bargained into mental hospital confinement and Dr. Banks' practice crumbling around him, the case seems closed. However, Dr. Banks cannot accept full responsibility and investigates to clear his name. What follows is a dark quest that threatens to tear what's left of his life apart even as he discovers the diabolical truth of this tragedy.", "tmdb_score_value": 6.5, "tmdb_score_count": 1539, "imdb_score_value": 7.1, "imdb_score_count": 161603, "meta_score_value": 75.0, "meta_score_count": 40}
