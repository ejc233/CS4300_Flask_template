But when Jenko meets a kindred spirit on the football team, and Schmidt infiltrates the bohemian art major scene, they begin to question their partnership. Now they don't have to just crack the case - they have to figure out if they can have a mature relationship. If these two overgrown adolescents can grow from freshmen into real men, college might be the best thing that ever happened to them.", "tmdb_score_value": 6.9, "tmdb_score_count": 4007, "imdb_score_value": 7.0, "imdb_score_count": 299459, "meta_score_value": 71.0, "meta_score_count": 46}
