He's got a beautiful wife and a baby on the way. The problem? He doesn't have \"his ducks in a row,\" which only fuels his doubts about being a good father. Guy has been trying to find work in his field for a year with no luck. At wit's end, his wife Anne finds him a job as a 'driver' on Craigslist. Guy shows up for the interview thinking he'll be delivering pizzas, but quickly realizes it's a job driving prostitutes. With money too scarce to turn down, he goes for it- which is where he meets Nikki, the tough-as-nails, unapologetic sex worker, and her two hilarious and foul-mouthed cohorts, Jaxi and Fallon. As reluctant driver and protector Guy is thrust into a world of rockin' women and feeble men. Over the course of one wild and sordid night, and several 'come-to-Jesus' moments, Guy proves to Nikki, and himself, that he does have what it takes to be the responsible father his family deserves.", "tokens": ["gui", "carter", "award", "win", "graduat", "student", "architectur", "he", "got", "beauti", "wife", "babi", "wai", "the", "problem", "he", "duck", "row", "fuel", "doubt", "good", "father", "gui", "try", "find", "work", "field", "year", "luck", "at", "wit", "end", "wife", "ann", "find", "job", "driver", "craigslist", "gui", "show", "interview", "think", "deliv", "pizza", "quickli", "realiz", "job", "drive", "prostitut", "with", "monei", "scarc", "turn", "goe", "meet", "nikki", "tough", "nail", "unapologet", "sex", "worker", "two", "hilari", "foul", "mouth", "cohort", "jaxi", "fallon", "as", "reluct", "driver", "protector", "gui", "thrust", "world", "rockin", "women", "feebl", "men", "over", "cours", "on", "wild", "sordid", "night", "sever", "come", "jesu", "moment", "gui", "prove", "nikki", "take", "respons", "father", "famili", "deserv"], "tmdb_score_value": 5.6, "tmdb_score_count": 61, "imdb_score_value": 5.0, "imdb_score_count": 3135, "meta_score_value": 38.0, "meta_score_count": 5}
