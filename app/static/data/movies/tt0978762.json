She's Mary Dinkle, the only child of an alcoholic mother and a distracted father. He's Max Horowitz, an overweight man with Asperger's, living alone in New York. He writes back, with chocolate. Thus begins a 20-year correspondence, interrupted by a stay in an asylum and a few misunderstandings. Mary falls in love with a neighbor, saves money to have a birthmark removed and deals with loss. Max has a friendship with a neighbor, tries to control his weight, and finally gets the dream job. Will the two ever meet face to face?", "tmdb_score_value": 7.7, "tmdb_score_count": 725, "imdb_score_value": 8.1, "imdb_score_count": 140740, "meta_score_value": 0.0, "meta_score_count": 0}
