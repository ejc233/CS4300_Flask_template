Twenty-eight years later, the initial welcome by the human population has faded. The refugee camp where the aliens were located has deteriorated into a militarized ghetto called District 9, where they are confined and exploited in squalor. In 2010, the munitions corporation, Multi-National United, is contracted to forcibly evict the population with operative Wikus van der Merwe in charge. In this operation, Wikus is exposed to a strange alien chemical and must rely on the help of his only two new 'Prawn' friends.", "tmdb_score_value": 7.3, "tmdb_score_count": 4192, "imdb_score_value": 8.0, "imdb_score_count": 579523, "meta_score_value": 81.0, "meta_score_count": 36}
