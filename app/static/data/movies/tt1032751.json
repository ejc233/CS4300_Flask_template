He carries the baby to his friend's desolate, broken-down town; the friend has died, so Yang reopens a laundry and settles down, hanging wet clothes, growing flowers, raising the infant, and finding himself attracted to Lynne, a red-haired woman with a tragic past. As long as Yang keeps his sword sheathed, his rivals won't find him, but a band of reprobate gunmen terrorize the town and threaten Lynne. Showdowns are inevitable, but once the sword is drawn, can Yang find rest, a home, and a family?", "tmdb_score_value": 6.3, "tmdb_score_count": 165, "imdb_score_value": 6.3, "imdb_score_count": 23507, "meta_score_value": 45.0, "meta_score_count": 11}
