From his early days with Kilburn and the High Roads, playing seedy pubs with no dressing rooms Ian moves onto chart success with the Blockheads, collaborating with musician Chaz Jankel. His private life is complicated as, separated from the tolerant Betty with whom he remains friends but refuses to divorce for many years, he lives with the much younger Denise along with his adored son Baxter, who will himself become a performer. Ian dies in 2000, having packed an enormous amount of living into a comparatively short life.", "tokens": ["flamboy", "entertain", "ian", "duri", "back", "blockhead", "take", "stage", "explain", "audienc", "child", "contract", "polio", "swim", "pool", "attend", "special", "need", "school", "bulli", "particularli", "orderli", "hargreav", "fact", "shape", "tough", "frequent", "iconoclast", "approach", "life", "culmin", "controversi", "contribut", "year", "disabl", "from", "earli", "dai", "kilburn", "high", "road", "plai", "seedi", "pub", "dress", "room", "ian", "move", "onto", "chart", "success", "blockhead", "collabor", "musician", "chaz", "jankel", "hi", "privat", "life", "complic", "separ", "toler", "betti", "remain", "friend", "refus", "divorc", "mani", "year", "live", "much", "younger", "denis", "along", "ador", "son", "baxter", "becom", "perform", "ian", "di", "2000", "pack", "enorm", "amount", "live", "compar", "short", "life"], "tmdb_score_value": 6.7, "tmdb_score_count": 22, "imdb_score_value": 6.6, "imdb_score_count": 3619, "meta_score_value": 57.0, "meta_score_count": 6}
