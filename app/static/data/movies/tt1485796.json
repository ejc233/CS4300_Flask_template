Thirsty for innovation and hungry for success, the son of a tailor will manage to open a wax museum but will soon shift focus to the unique and peculiar, introducing extraordinary, never-seen-before live acts on the circus stage. Some will call Barnum's wide collection of oddities, a freak show; however, when the obsessed showman gambles everything on the opera singer Jenny Lind to appeal to a high-brow audience, he will somehow lose sight of the most important aspect of his life: his family. Will Barnum risk it all to be accepted?", "tmdb_score_value": 8.0, "tmdb_score_count": 1913, "imdb_score_value": 7.8, "imdb_score_count": 105211, "meta_score_value": 48.0, "meta_score_count": 43}
