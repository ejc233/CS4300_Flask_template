A woman, miserable in her circumscribed life caring for her domineering mother, finds a body. Somehow, this discovery allows her to change. At the morgue, the sister of a girl missing for 15 years believes the body is that of her sister; this liberates her. An older woman, married to a man who pays her little attention, finds evidence in a storage unit; how will she handle it? The mother of the dead girl, who left home some years before, visits the last place her daughter lived and makes her own discoveries. Last, we flash back to the victim's final day.", "tmdb_score_value": 6.3, "tmdb_score_count": 83, "imdb_score_value": 6.7, "imdb_score_count": 13228, "meta_score_value": 65.0, "meta_score_count": 21}
