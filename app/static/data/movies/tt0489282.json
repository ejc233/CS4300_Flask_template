After ratings plummet and the show is canceled, we watch a long flashback to see its demise. The studio head gives the show two more weeks. An old friend brings a story about Bigfoot in Ecuador, so a long road trip ensues with stops along the way and enough problems, misjudgments, and deaths to sink a less intrepid band. Peter's team faces competition from a better-funded and more practiced set of rivals. Who will find Bigfoot first, and will they get it on tape and save the show? Can Peter make dad proud?", "tmdb_score_value": 4.7, "tmdb_score_count": 89, "imdb_score_value": 5.3, "imdb_score_count": 19624, "meta_score_value": 12.0, "meta_score_count": 12}
