The trio - Chiba, Tokita, and Shima - assisted by a police inspector and by a sprite named Paprika must try to identify the thief as they ward off the thief's attacks on their own psyches. Dreams, reality, and the movies merge, while characters question the limits of science and the wisdom of Big Brother.", "tmdb_score_value": 7.7, "tmdb_score_count": 562, "imdb_score_value": 7.7, "imdb_score_count": 54918, "meta_score_value": 81.0, "meta_score_count": 26}
