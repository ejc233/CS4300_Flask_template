It doesn't help that the two have slept together and he harbours lingering feelings for her. Her unresolved anger threatens to ruin the gym's relationship with a wealthy new client, Danny, played by Kevin Corrigan. Matters are further jeopardized when Trevor, trying to smooth the situation, gives way to his own emotions instead. In spite of their best efforts, neither is able to truly move on. The business risk Trevor is in too deep to back away from and the uncertainty of something more with Kat threatens to profoundly impact both their lives.", "tokens": ["the", "healthi", "live", "philosophi", "ultra", "posit", "gym", "owner", "trevor", "plai", "gui", "pearc", "test", "employe", "kat", "pragmat", "approach", "plai", "cobi", "smulder", "it", "help", "two", "slept", "togeth", "harbour", "linger", "feel", "her", "unresolv", "anger", "threaten", "ruin", "gym", "relationship", "wealthi", "new", "client", "danni", "plai", "kevin", "corrigan", "matter", "jeopard", "trevor", "try", "smooth", "situat", "give", "wai", "emot", "instead", "in", "spite", "best", "effort", "neither", "abl", "truli", "move", "the", "busi", "risk", "trevor", "deep", "back", "awai", "uncertainti", "someth", "kat", "threaten", "profoundli", "impact", "live"], "tmdb_score_value": 5.1, "tmdb_score_count": 81, "imdb_score_value": 5.4, "imdb_score_count": 5276, "meta_score_value": 73.0, "meta_score_count": 29}
