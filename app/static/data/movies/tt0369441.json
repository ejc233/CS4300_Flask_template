Jobless, and with no savings, pension, or home equity, Dick and his wife Jane sink slowly into poverty. He looks for work (as do all former Globodyne executives); he even tries day labor with the relatives of their Mexican nanny. A foreclosure notice sends Dick and Jane over the edge into a life of blue-collar crime. Then, as things finally look up, the report of an looming indictment pushes Dick and Jane toward a denouement with the real criminals, the white-collar guys.", "tmdb_score_value": 5.9, "tmdb_score_count": 821, "imdb_score_value": 6.1, "imdb_score_count": 119981, "meta_score_value": 47.0, "meta_score_count": 33}
