However, when graduation comes and Jill moves cross-country to go to college, she then loses over 50 lbs - much to Matt's surprise when he arrives to visit her. While Matt struggles to accept Jill's new body, Jill begins to question whether Matt is really the man she wants to date. As the distance widens between them, the characters are propelled onto a collision course with brutality and loss, forcing them to confront who they are, who they were, and who everyone thinks they're supposed to be.", "tokens": ["when", "on", "ei", "high", "school", "senior", "matt", "meet", "250", "lb", "jill", "fall", "love", "ever", "thought", "possibl", "howev", "graduat", "come", "jill", "move", "cross", "countri", "go", "colleg", "lose", "50", "lb", "much", "matt", "surpris", "arriv", "visit", "while", "matt", "struggl", "accept", "jill", "new", "bodi", "jill", "begin", "question", "whether", "matt", "realli", "man", "want", "date", "as", "distanc", "widen", "charact", "propel", "onto", "collis", "cours", "brutal", "loss", "forc", "confront", "everyon", "think", "suppos"], "tmdb_score_value": 7.0, "tmdb_score_count": 21, "imdb_score_value": 6.3, "imdb_score_count": 1191, "meta_score_value": 67.0, "meta_score_count": 6}
