Taking stock of their surroundings, they arm themselves, lock down the mall, and destroy the zombies inside so they can eke out a living--at least for a while. Tensions begin to build as months go on, and they come to realize that they've fallen prey to consumerism. Soon afterward, they have even heavier problems to worry about, as a large gang of bikers discovers the mall and invades it, ruining the survivors' best-laid plans and forcing them to fight off both lethal bandits and flesh-eating zombies.", "tmdb_score_value": 7.5, "tmdb_score_count": 713, "imdb_score_value": 8.0, "imdb_score_count": 98507, "meta_score_value": 71.0, "meta_score_count": 14}
