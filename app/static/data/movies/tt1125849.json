As he faces health problems that may end his wrestling career for good he attempts to come to terms with his life outside the ring: by working full time at the grocery store, trying to reconcile with the daughter he abandoned in childhood and forming a closer bond with a stripper he has romantic feelings for. He struggles with his new life and an offer of a high-profile rematch with his 1980s arch-nemesis, The Ayatollah, which may be his ticket back to stardom.", "tmdb_score_value": 7.3, "tmdb_score_count": 1330, "imdb_score_value": 7.9, "imdb_score_count": 269428, "meta_score_value": 81.0, "meta_score_count": 36}
