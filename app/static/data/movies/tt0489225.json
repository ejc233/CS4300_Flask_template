Cameron is a volatile teen who commits grand theft auto just because the car is an exact replica from Christine. Their relationship is forged in the darkness of a movie theater and fueled by a mutual appreciation of rebellion and cinema. Cameron enters a student film contest, though he lacks the resources of his peers. Learning that Flash is a retired Hollywood gaffer-and the only surviving crew member from Citizen Kane-Cameron follows him to his home at the Motion Picture Residence for the Elderly, a colony of aging film folk set aside by the industry. A quirky fellowship develops, in which Flash and his friends help Cameron make his film, and, in doing so, change his life.", "tokens": ["young", "social", "misfit", "form", "unlik", "friendship", "bitter", "old", "film", "industri", "technician", "enlist", "latter", "help", "make", "student", "film", "learn", "much", "life", "process", "sensit", "relat", "expert", "movi", "maker", "young", "talent", "movi", "make", "young", "talent", "got", "on", "best", "teacher", "expert", "maker", "got", "on", "best", "friend", "life", "movi", "make", "movi", "see", "life", "see", "show", "learn", "make", "man", "chair"], "tmdb_score_value": 6.3, "tmdb_score_count": 7, "imdb_score_value": 7.2, "imdb_score_count": 1572, "meta_score_value": 44.0, "meta_score_count": 12}
