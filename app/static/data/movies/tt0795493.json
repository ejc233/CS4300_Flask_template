When rich Uncle Howard comes to town and agrees to help them out, he admits his finances are under investigation, and he asks them to do him a favor and \"take care of\" an old business relation to keep his trouble under wraps - he says that they're family, and since he always takes care of them, the least they could do is help him out this once, as they're the only ones he can trust. The film follows their struggle with the immorality of this request and how each brother chooses to deal with it.", "tmdb_score_value": 6.1, "tmdb_score_count": 294, "imdb_score_value": 6.7, "imdb_score_count": 46873, "meta_score_value": 49.0, "meta_score_count": 31}
