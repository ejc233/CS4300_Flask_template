Rainbow? Leeward and Mary cannot even agree on their three year old daughter's name anymore. Mary is a hardworking nurse who dreams of only one thing: changing her life. She resents her husband for being an irresponsible, overgrown adolescent, incapable of holding down a job. Leeward is an atypical, idealistic musician who fancies himself a misunderstood artist and a New Age visionary. Enter Lilas, a 19 year old French artist and the daughter of a world famous painter, who is trying to make it in New York and get away from an overbearing mother. When the bubbly young woman moves into the couple's tiny Chinatown apartment, their already fragile balance is upset even further. Between surrealism, unusual characters, art and magic tricks, Swim Little Fish Swim is a dreamlike journey from childhood to adulthood.", "tokens": ["maggi", "rainbow", "leeward", "mari", "cannot", "even", "agre", "three", "year", "old", "daughter", "name", "anymor", "mari", "hardwork", "nurs", "dream", "on", "thing", "chang", "life", "she", "resent", "husband", "irrespons", "overgrown", "adolesc", "incap", "hold", "job", "leeward", "atyp", "idealist", "musician", "fanci", "misunderstood", "artist", "new", "ag", "visionari", "enter", "lila", "19", "year", "old", "french", "artist", "daughter", "world", "famou", "painter", "try", "make", "new", "york", "get", "awai", "overbear", "mother", "when", "bubbl", "young", "woman", "move", "coupl", "tini", "chinatown", "apart", "alreadi", "fragil", "balanc", "upset", "even", "between", "surreal", "unusu", "charact", "art", "magic", "trick", "swim", "littl", "fish", "swim", "dreamlik", "journei", "childhood", "adulthood"], "tmdb_score_value": 5.7, "tmdb_score_count": 6, "imdb_score_value": 7.0, "imdb_score_count": 780, "meta_score_value": 54.0, "meta_score_count": 9}
