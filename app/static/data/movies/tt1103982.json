It's October, 2008: a presidential election nears and the economy is in free fall. She has a boyfriend, Chris (Chris Santos), who's a personal trainer. We are shown five non-consecutive days in Chelsea's life. She's working on her Web page, talking to image consultants, and being interviewed by a reporter. She asks clients when their birthdays are and uses that for an astrological prediction. She's drawn to a new client, a writer from L.A. Should she break her rules for him? What if it risks her relationship with Chris? Should she invest in gold?", "tmdb_score_value": 5.3, "tmdb_score_count": 104, "imdb_score_value": 5.5, "imdb_score_count": 14690, "meta_score_value": 66.0, "meta_score_count": 26}
