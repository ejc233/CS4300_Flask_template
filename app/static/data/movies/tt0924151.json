Medics arrived, became suspicious of Kurtz's art, and called the FBI. Within hours the artist was detained as a suspected \"bioterrorist\", as dozens of agents in Hazmat suits sifted through his work and impounded his computers, manuscripts, books, cat, and even his wife's body. Today Kurtz and his long-time collaborator Dr. Robert Ferrell, former Chair of the Genetics Department at the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health, await a trial date.", "tokens": ["a", "documentari", "art", "teacher", "buffalo", "investig", "terror", "wife", "suddenli", "di", "911", "respond", "see", "bilog", "paraphenalia", "live", "room", "artist", "obtain", "peic", "genet", "modifi", "organ", "the", "fear", "escal", "feder", "agent", "postur", "threat", "meantim", "artist", "scrambl", "find", "protect", "world", "gone", "crazi"], "tmdb_score_value": 5.0, "tmdb_score_count": 2, "imdb_score_value": 6.2, "imdb_score_count": 333, "meta_score_value": 70.0, "meta_score_count": 9}
