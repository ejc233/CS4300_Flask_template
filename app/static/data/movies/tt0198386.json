Taking a man that was found dead on the beach, they arrange what appears to a mob hit and provide a note that says more killings are to occur. Unfortunately the old man they use turns out to be the senile father of a drug lord. The drug lord declares war on the killers of his father, thinking it was an action of his enemies. A stripper learns of the old men's involvement and threatens to squeal on them unless they kill her stepmother. Meanwhile, one man searches for his long-lost daughter, who is the investigating police officer, trying to divest herself from her crumb fellow officer and former boyfriend.", "tokens": ["four", "former", "made", "men", "struggl", "get", "rundown", "miami", "hotel", "come", "plot", "drive", "young", "tenant", "slowli", "take", "beach", "front", "hotel", "drive", "rent", "take", "man", "found", "dead", "beach", "arrang", "appear", "mob", "hit", "provid", "note", "sai", "kill", "occur", "unfortun", "old", "man", "us", "turn", "senil", "father", "drug", "lord", "the", "drug", "lord", "declar", "war", "killer", "father", "think", "action", "enemi", "a", "stripper", "learn", "old", "men", "involv", "threaten", "squeal", "unless", "kill", "stepmoth", "meanwhil", "on", "man", "search", "long", "lost", "daughter", "investig", "polic", "offic", "try", "divest", "crumb", "fellow", "offic", "former", "boyfriend"], "tmdb_score_value": 6.0, "tmdb_score_count": 13, "imdb_score_value": 5.6, "imdb_score_count": 4182, "meta_score_value": 37.0, "meta_score_count": 28}
