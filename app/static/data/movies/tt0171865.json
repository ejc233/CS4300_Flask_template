They're lonely Londoners. Nadia, a cafe waitress, places personal ads, looking for love; Debbie, a single mom, entertains men at the hair salon after hours; her son spends part of the weekend with her ex, a man with a hair-trigger temper. Molly is expecting her first baby and its father acts as if the responsibility is too much for him. Eileen is bitter, complaining about her husband and the dog next door; Bill's a doormat. His West Indian neighbor offers him a drink; her own grown son locks himself in his room most of the time. Will anyone connect during this Guy Fawkes weekend?", "tokens": ["there", "littl", "wonder", "work", "class", "live", "bill", "eileen", "three", "grown", "daughter", "thei", "lone", "london", "nadia", "cafe", "waitress", "place", "person", "ad", "look", "love", "debbi", "singl", "mom", "entertain", "men", "hair", "salon", "hour", "son", "spend", "part", "weekend", "ex", "man", "hair", "trigger", "temper", "molli", "expect", "first", "babi", "father", "act", "respons", "much", "eileen", "bitter", "complain", "husband", "dog", "next", "door", "bill", "doormat", "hi", "west", "indian", "neighbor", "offer", "drink", "grown", "son", "lock", "room", "time", "will", "anyon", "connect", "gui", "fawk", "weekend"], "tmdb_score_value": 6.8, "tmdb_score_count": 12, "imdb_score_value": 7.2, "imdb_score_count": 3721, "meta_score_value": 71.0, "meta_score_count": 28}
