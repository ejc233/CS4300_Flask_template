When Clover Catto (Ellie Kendrick) receives a call telling her that her younger brother Harry (Joe Blakemore) is dead, she must return to her family farm and face the man she hasn't spoken to in years: her father Aubrey (David Troughton). She is shocked to discover her home changed forever by the devastating floods that destroyed the area six months earlier, and Aubrey a tormented shadow of his former self. As she learns what has been going on in her long absence she and her father forge a new understanding, but can it withstand the troubles that they face on the ravaged farm as well as the truth of what drove Harry to take his own life?", "tokens": ["somerset", "octob", "2014", "when", "clover", "catto", "elli", "kendrick", "receiv", "call", "tell", "younger", "brother", "harri", "joe", "blakemor", "dead", "must", "return", "famili", "farm", "face", "man", "spoken", "year", "father", "aubrei", "david", "troughton", "she", "shock", "discov", "home", "chang", "forev", "devast", "flood", "destroi", "area", "six", "month", "earlier", "aubrei", "torment", "shadow", "former", "self", "as", "learn", "go", "long", "absenc", "father", "forg", "new", "understand", "withstand", "troubl", "face", "ravag", "farm", "well", "truth", "drove", "harri", "take", "life"], "tmdb_score_value": 6.2, "tmdb_score_count": 18, "imdb_score_value": 6.4, "imdb_score_count": 1754, "meta_score_value": 81.0, "meta_score_count": 8}
