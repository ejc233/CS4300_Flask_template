It's a place rigged with hundreds of social landmines, not the least of which are morons, wedgies, swirlies, bullies, lunchtime banishment to the cafeteria floor - and a festering piece of cheese with nuclear cooties. To survive the never-ending ordeal and attain the recognition and status he feels he so richly deserves, Greg devises an endless series of can't-miss schemes, all of which, of course, go awry. And he's getting it all down on paper, via a diary - \"it's NOT a diary, it's a journal!\" Greg insists, preferring the less-sissyfied designation - filled with his opinions, thoughts, tales of family trials and tribulations, and (would-be) schoolyard triumphs. \"One day when I'm famous,\" writes Greg, \"I'll have better things to do than answer people's stupid questions all day.\" So was born the Wimpy Kid's diary.", "tmdb_score_value": 5.9, "tmdb_score_count": 477, "imdb_score_value": 6.2, "imdb_score_count": 36288, "meta_score_value": 56.0, "meta_score_count": 27}
