When released, he calls on the family of the victim; they send him away, but not before he has seen Gong-ju, a young woman disabled severely by cerebral palsy. Both are abused by their families, and both are used by them as well. Although their relationship begins with Jong-du's criminal behavior, a friendship develops. They talk of favorite things; he washes her hair; they go out; in late night phone calls, he helps her past her fears of the dark. Is there a place in the world for these two inarticulate people?", "tokens": ["jong", "du", "young", "man", "prison", "manslaught", "social", "misfit", "fidgeti", "snuffl", "laugh", "inappropri", "without", "super", "ego", "when", "releas", "call", "famili", "victim", "send", "awai", "seen", "gong", "ju", "young", "woman", "disabl", "sever", "cerebr", "palsi", "both", "abus", "famili", "us", "well", "although", "relationship", "begin", "jong", "du", "crimin", "behavior", "friendship", "develop", "thei", "talk", "favorit", "thing", "wash", "hair", "go", "late", "night", "phone", "call", "help", "past", "fear", "dark", "is", "place", "world", "two", "inarticul", "peopl"], "tmdb_score_value": 7.7, "tmdb_score_count": 55, "imdb_score_value": 8.0, "imdb_score_count": 6156, "meta_score_value": 79.0, "meta_score_count": 14}
