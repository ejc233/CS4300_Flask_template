Problem is, nobody loves a Bad Guy. But they do love heroes... so when a modern, first-person shooter game arrives featuring tough-as-nails Sergeant Calhoun, Ralph sees it as his ticket to heroism and happiness. He sneaks into the game with a simple plan -- win a medal -- but soon wrecks everything, and accidentally unleashes a deadly enemy that threatens every game in the arcade. Ralph's only hope? Vanellope von Schweetz, a young troublemaking \"glitch\" from a candy-coated cart racing game who might just be the one to teach Ralph what it means to be a Good Guy. But will he realize he is good enough to become a hero before it's \"Game Over\" for the entire arcade?", "tmdb_score_value": 7.1, "tmdb_score_count": 5497, "imdb_score_value": 7.7, "imdb_score_count": 308625, "meta_score_value": 72.0, "meta_score_count": 37}
