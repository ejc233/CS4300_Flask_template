A fugitive priest, he then witnesses the murder of a traveling performer--and subsequently, the mourning of actor by his fellow troupe members. He eventually becomes initiated into the troupe as a player, replacing the murdered man. They travel from town to town performing their standard morality play. They arrive in a town where a boy has been killed and a young deaf-mute girl has been imprisoned for the crime--sentenced to death for witchcraft and murder. Discarding the expected bible stories, the actors stage a performance based on the crime. Through the performance of the play, they discover that the townspeople know the young woman did not, in fact, commit the murder. The stage becomes a place where vital human truth is told. Thus, simultaneously, the fugitive priest comes to terms with his own crime and makes a powerful sacrifice, thereby redeeming himself.", "tokens": ["in", "14th", "centuri", "england", "young", "monk", "break", "vow", "chastiti", "flee", "wrath", "bishop", "fellow", "monk", "a", "fugit", "priest", "wit", "murder", "travel", "perform", "subsequ", "mourn", "actor", "fellow", "troup", "member", "he", "eventu", "becom", "initi", "troup", "player", "replac", "murder", "man", "thei", "travel", "town", "town", "perform", "standard", "moral", "plai", "thei", "arriv", "town", "boi", "kill", "young", "deaf", "mute", "girl", "imprison", "crime", "sentenc", "death", "witchcraft", "murder", "discard", "expect", "bibl", "stori", "actor", "stage", "perform", "base", "crime", "through", "perform", "plai", "discov", "townspeopl", "know", "young", "woman", "fact", "commit", "murder", "the", "stage", "becom", "place", "vital", "human", "truth", "told", "thu", "simultan", "fugit", "priest", "come", "term", "crime", "make", "power", "sacrific", "therebi", "redeem"], "tmdb_score_value": 6.3, "tmdb_score_count": 38, "imdb_score_value": 6.6, "imdb_score_count": 5282, "meta_score_value": 49.0, "meta_score_count": 28}
