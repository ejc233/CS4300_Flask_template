Beside the body, lies a diary that documents a journey of starvation and the loss of sanity, but told with poignance, beauty, humor, and spirituality.

As her story unfolds from different perspectives, including her own, we learn about our systemic failure to protect those who cannot protect themselves.", "tokens": ["the", "bodi", "homeless", "woman", "found", "abandon", "new", "hampshir", "farmhous", "besid", "bodi", "li", "diari", "document", "journei", "starvat", "loss", "saniti", "told", "poignanc", "beauti", "humor", "spiritu", "for", "nearli", "four", "month", "linda", "bishop", "surviv", "appl", "rain", "water", "wait", "god", "save", "on", "coldest", "winter", "record", "as", "stori", "unfold", "differ", "perspect", "includ", "learn", "system", "failur", "protect", "cannot", "protect"], "tmdb_score_value": 8.0, "tmdb_score_count": 1, "imdb_score_value": 7.6, "imdb_score_count": 86, "meta_score_value": 66.0, "meta_score_count": 11}
