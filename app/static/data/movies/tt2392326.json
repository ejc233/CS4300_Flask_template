He is staid, annoying his foul-mouthed wife who wants to turn the holiday into a series of exciting new experiences, booking into a hotel that stretches their budgets and running off from a restaurant without paying. She is also averse to his touching her and what was meant to be a belated second honeymoon is a depressing affair, full of arguments - including one about the son who has recently left home to live in squalor and whom Meg does not want to return. By chance they meet an old university friend of Nick, Morgan, an American high-flyer who invites them to a party where Meg can still turn men's heads and Nick has a conversation with Morgan's young son, leading him to believe that he is not as badly off as he had presumed. Ultimately there appears to be hope for the marriage.", "tokens": ["meg", "teacher", "husband", "nick", "philosophi", "lectur", "mai", "get", "push", "ev", "retir", "spend", "week", "end", "pari", "celebr", "thirtieth", "anniversari", "he", "staid", "annoi", "foul", "mouth", "wife", "want", "turn", "holidai", "seri", "excit", "new", "experi", "book", "hotel", "stretch", "budget", "run", "restaur", "without", "pai", "she", "also", "avers", "touch", "meant", "belat", "second", "honeymoon", "depress", "affair", "full", "argument", "includ", "on", "son", "recent", "left", "home", "live", "squalor", "meg", "want", "return", "by", "chanc", "meet", "old", "univers", "friend", "nick", "morgan", "american", "high", "flyer", "invit", "parti", "meg", "still", "turn", "men", "head", "nick", "convers", "morgan", "young", "son", "lead", "believ", "badli", "presum", "ultim", "appear", "hope", "marriag"], "tmdb_score_value": 6.3, "tmdb_score_count": 62, "imdb_score_value": 6.3, "imdb_score_count": 6869, "meta_score_value": 73.0, "meta_score_count": 29}
