From then on his family was cursed with bad luck.

It never rains at Camp Green Lake, it hasn't for one hundred years. The secretive and mysterious Warden has each inmate spend every day digging one hole to \"build character.\" But when an artifact from the famous \"Kissin' Kate\" Barlow is found in a hole, the Warden forces the boys to work double time leading Stanley to deduce they're digging because the Warden is looking for something. But what? And how is the mystery of Camp Green Lake connected to Stanley's family curse?", "tmdb_score_value": 6.7, "tmdb_score_count": 495, "imdb_score_value": 7.1, "imdb_score_count": 65595, "meta_score_value": 71.0, "meta_score_count": 28}
