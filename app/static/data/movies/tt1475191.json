Exploring the deeply complex issues at the heart of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, American Radical is the insightful and enraging documentary that follows Finkelstein around the world as he attempts to negotiate a voice among impassioned critics and supporters. Uncompromising even in the face of his recent denial of tenure at DePaul University, Finkelstein is a complex and supremely lonely figure whose self-destructive nature often undermines his academic credibility. A guaranteed argument starter, this potent documentary plunges viewers into the psychological and intellectual underpinnings of a vitriolic personality.", "tokens": ["i", "find", "plot", "summari", "opinion", "finkelstein", "mai", "solitari", "mai", "even", "alon", "strong", "assumpt", "sai", "lone", "self", "destruct", "natur", "often", "undermin", "academ", "credibl", "oh", "yeah", "don", "confus", "zionist", "bile", "intend", "discredit", "did", "hear", "prais", "noam", "chomski", "academ", "work", "i", "think", "confus", "passion", "determin", "integr", "word", "might", "gener", "enough", "acknowledg", "fit", "anoth", "rabbl", "rouser", "ye", "comb", "anyon", "less", "true", "warrior", "would", "surviv", "long", "convict", "intact", "and", "surviv", "tremend", "odd", "still", "fight", "israel", "human", "soul", "finkelstein", "certainli"], "tmdb_score_value": 6.0, "tmdb_score_count": 2, "imdb_score_value": 8.0, "imdb_score_count": 680, "meta_score_value": 71.0, "meta_score_count": 6}
