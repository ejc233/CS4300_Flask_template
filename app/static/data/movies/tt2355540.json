For many of those years, his wife, Noriko, has been a faithful companion to this idiosyncratic man, but grew wanting to be more. This film covers the relationship of this special couple as Ushio struggles for commercial success on his own terms. Additionally, we follow Noriko pursuing her own artistic vision with her semi-autobiographical line art project that reveals much about her own soul as eloquently as her husband's work.", "tokens": ["for", "year", "ushio", "shinohara", "on", "lead", "appreci", "altern", "artist", "japan", "new", "york", "citi", "wildli", "esoter", "style", "for", "mani", "year", "wife", "noriko", "faith", "companion", "idiosyncrat", "man", "grew", "want", "thi", "film", "cover", "relationship", "special", "coupl", "ushio", "struggl", "commerci", "success", "term", "addition", "follow", "noriko", "pursu", "artist", "vision", "semi", "autobiograph", "line", "art", "project", "reveal", "much", "soul", "eloqu", "husband", "work"], "tmdb_score_value": 7.2, "tmdb_score_count": 41, "imdb_score_value": 7.2, "imdb_score_count": 4163, "meta_score_value": 83.0, "meta_score_count": 25}
