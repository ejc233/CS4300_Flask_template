Uses contemporary interviews, archival footage, and recreations to tell the story of his previous walks between towers of Notre Dame and of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, his passions and friendships, and the details of the night before the walk: getting cable into the towers, hiding from guards, and mounting the wire. It ends with observations of the profound changes the walk's success brought to Philippe and those closest to him.", "tmdb_score_value": 7.5, "tmdb_score_count": 363, "imdb_score_value": 7.8, "imdb_score_count": 46710, "meta_score_value": 89.0, "meta_score_count": 31}
