But after a fun night out night surfing and what should be a fun day in the water, she is attacked by a shark and loses her arm. Rushed to the hospital, she remains calm, and maintains her faith in God. Now she has to re-learn how to do everything with only one arm - including how to surf. It will take her friends, family, and her Christian faith to get her back into the water, but if that is where she is meant to be, she will find a way to get there.", "tmdb_score_value": 7.0, "tmdb_score_count": 456, "imdb_score_value": 7.1, "imdb_score_count": 39361, "meta_score_value": 53.0, "meta_score_count": 27}
