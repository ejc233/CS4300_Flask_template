Payne is a killin' machine, but the wars of the world are no longer fought on the battlefield. A career Marine, he has no idea what to do as a civilian, so his commander finds him a job - commanding officer of a local school's JROTC program, a bunch or ragtag losers with no hope. Using such teaching tools as live grenades and real bullets, Payne starts to instill the Corps with some hope. But when Payne is recalled to fight in Bosnia, will he leave the Corps that has just started to believe in him, or will he find out that killin' ain't much of a livin'?", "tmdb_score_value": 6.0, "tmdb_score_count": 218, "imdb_score_value": 6.2, "imdb_score_count": 25613, "meta_score_value": 0.0, "meta_score_count": 0}
