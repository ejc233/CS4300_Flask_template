Jan D\u00edte is released from prison after serving 15 years. He goes into semi exile in a deserted village near the German border. In flashbacks, he tells his story: he's a small, clever and quick-witted young man, stubbornly na\u00efve, a vendor at a train station. Thanks to a patron, he becomes a waiter at upscale hotels and restaurants. We see him discover how the wealthy tick and how to please women. He strives to be a millionaire with his own hotel. Before the war, he meets L\u00edza, a German woman in Prague. Is this his ticket to wealth or his undoing? Meanwhile, we see Jan putting a life together after prison: why was he sentenced, and who will he become?", "tokens": ["czechoslovakia", "1963", "jan", "d\u00edte", "releas", "prison", "serv", "15", "year", "he", "goe", "semi", "exil", "desert", "villag", "near", "german", "border", "in", "flashback", "tell", "stori", "small", "clever", "quick", "wit", "young", "man", "stubbornli", "na\u00efv", "vendor", "train", "station", "thank", "patron", "becom", "waiter", "upscal", "hotel", "restaur", "we", "see", "discov", "wealthi", "tick", "pleas", "women", "he", "strive", "millionair", "hotel", "befor", "war", "meet", "l\u00edza", "german", "woman", "pragu", "is", "ticket", "wealth", "undo", "meanwhil", "see", "jan", "put", "life", "togeth", "prison", "sentenc", "becom"], "tmdb_score_value": 7.0, "tmdb_score_count": 29, "imdb_score_value": 7.4, "imdb_score_count": 6689, "meta_score_value": 72.0, "meta_score_count": 26}
