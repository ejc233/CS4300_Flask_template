By chance, he runs into his former girlfriend Cecile, who works as a dancer at a cabaret under the stage name Lola. She is now a single mom and works hard to provide her young son with all of the necessities of life. Lola still hopes that her son's father Michel, the true love of her life, will someday return to them. Seeing Lola again confirms to Roland that he's still in love with her, but she doesn't return his feelings. He has also met Madame Desnoyer and her 14-year-old daughter, also called Cecile. Madame Desnoyer, a widow, is quite taken with Roland but he has little interest in her. Roland sees no future if he stays in France.", "tokens": ["roland", "cassard", "young", "man", "job", "seemingli", "prospect", "by", "chanc", "run", "former", "girlfriend", "cecil", "work", "dancer", "cabaret", "stage", "name", "lola", "she", "singl", "mom", "work", "hard", "provid", "young", "son", "necess", "life", "lola", "still", "hope", "son", "father", "michel", "true", "love", "life", "somedai", "return", "see", "lola", "confirm", "roland", "still", "love", "return", "feel", "he", "also", "met", "madam", "desnoy", "14", "year", "old", "daughter", "also", "call", "cecil", "madam", "desnoy", "widow", "quit", "taken", "roland", "littl", "interest", "roland", "see", "futur", "stai", "franc"], "tmdb_score_value": 7.2, "tmdb_score_count": 37, "imdb_score_value": 7.6, "imdb_score_count": 3832, "meta_score_value": 73.0, "meta_score_count": 4}
