The Cloverfield Station with a multinational crew will test the Shepard particle accelerator expecting to generate energy for all countries solving the energy problem. However, the experiment goes wrong, damages the station and opens a portal to another dimension with a parallel Earth. They also find a woman entwined with wires behind a bulkhead of the station and they learn she worked in an identical Cloverfield Station in another dimension. Now the scientists need to find a way to return to their own dimension.", "tmdb_score_value": 5.7, "tmdb_score_count": 884, "imdb_score_value": 5.6, "imdb_score_count": 61120, "meta_score_value": 37.0, "meta_score_count": 27}
