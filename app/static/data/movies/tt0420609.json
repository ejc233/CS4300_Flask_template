There are no suspects. With Harper Lee, he visits the town: he wants to write about their response. First he must get locals to talk, then, after arrests, he must gain access to the prisoners. One talks constantly; the other, Perry Smith, says little. Capote is implacable, wanting the story, believing this book will establish a new form of reportage: he must figure out what Perry wants. Their relationship becomes something more than writer and character: Perry killed in cold blood, the state will execute him in cold blood; does Capote get his story through cold calculation, or is there a price for him to pay?", "tmdb_score_value": 6.4, "tmdb_score_count": 73, "imdb_score_value": 7.1, "imdb_score_count": 15125, "meta_score_value": 68.0, "meta_score_count": 34}
