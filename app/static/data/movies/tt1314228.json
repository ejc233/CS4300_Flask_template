He's a Manhattan lawyer, seeking forgiveness. She's moved on, focusing on real estate sales. As he walks her to an appointment one evening, pleading his case, they witness a murder, and the murderer sees them. The F.B.I. wants them in Witness Protection until the killer is caught. He's already hunting them. The F.B.I. sends them to Ray, Wyoming, a tiny ranch town, where they stay with the aging Sheriff and his gun-toting wife (who's his Deputy). Meryl and Paul must sort out their relationship while their New York City ways bump up against those of the West.
