The one thing that Charlie doesn't have is love because every time he starts to fall for a girl, his brain chemistry changes and he goes clinically insane. When he meets Molly Kingston (Ali Larter), a former dancer who just might be his perfect match, Charlie is confronted with the consequences of his condition. With the help of his friend Jason (Adam Rodriguez) and the often misguided advice from his wacky neighbor Lester (Chevy Chase), Charlie must find a way to overcome his psychosis to claim his chance at true love.", "tokens": ["lovesick", "comic", "tale", "charli", "darbi", "matt", "leblanc", "man", "everyth", "go", "great", "job", "elementari", "school", "princip", "support", "friend", "wonder", "life", "the", "on", "thing", "charli", "love", "everi", "time", "start", "fall", "girl", "brain", "chemistri", "chang", "goe", "clinic", "insan", "when", "meet", "molli", "kingston", "ali", "larter", "former", "dancer", "might", "perfect", "match", "charli", "confront", "consequ", "condit", "with", "help", "friend", "jason", "adam", "rodriguez", "often", "misguid", "advic", "wacki", "neighbor", "lester", "chevi", "chase", "charli", "must", "find", "wai", "overcom", "psychosi", "claim", "chanc", "true", "love"], "tmdb_score_value": 4.8, "tmdb_score_count": 40, "imdb_score_value": 5.2, "imdb_score_count": 2390, "meta_score_value": 31.0, "meta_score_count": 6}
