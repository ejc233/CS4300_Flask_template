Using a dim-witted stunt man as their getaway driver and lookout, the three successfully pull off several jobs (even gaining the attention of a television show about American criminals), and become known as \"The Sleepover Bandits.\" Things are going great until the bank managers begin to realize that the robbers are non-violent and therefore no threat to them or their employees, changing the game for the Bandits. To add to the complications, a bored &amp; unhappy housewife (Blanchett) ends up in the hands of the criminals, and begins to have romantic feelings for both Willis and Thornton, causing a sticky love triangle.", "tmdb_score_value": 6.1, "tmdb_score_count": 381, "imdb_score_value": 6.5, "imdb_score_count": 60413, "meta_score_value": 60.0, "meta_score_count": 32}
