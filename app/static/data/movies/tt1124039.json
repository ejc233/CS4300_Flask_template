He receives an anonymous gift: a phone which sends messages that enable him to win at a casino. Max soon finds himself pursed by hit men, the casino's security chief, and a CIA operative. Who's sending Max messages? Previous recipients of similar windfalls have ended up dead. After a couple of close scrapes, Max realizes he's in danger, so he tries to find out the root of the conspiracy - which seems to have access to every security camera in the world - before he's the next victim. Why is this happening to him, and who can he trust?", "tmdb_score_value": 5.4, "tmdb_score_count": 131, "imdb_score_value": 5.8, "imdb_score_count": 17756, "meta_score_value": 26.0, "meta_score_count": 5}
