Cars are abandoned in the street, food is left cooking on the stove. We meet the wife of a musician who's gone, a state Senator whose maid doesn't show up for work, and a farm owner whose produce is ripe and unpicked. A scientist asks any Mexicans who haven't disappeared to volunteer for genetic experiments: a female newscaster and the daughter of the musician may be the only missing links around. Why them? And where have all the Mexicans gone? Even the border guards grieve. The state and its economy grind to a halt.", "tokens": ["a", "thick", "fog", "surround", "california", "border", "commun", "beyond", "state", "line", "cut", "mexican", "disappear", "worker", "spous", "busi", "owner", "miss", "car", "abandon", "street", "food", "left", "cook", "stove", "we", "meet", "wife", "musician", "gone", "state", "senat", "whose", "maid", "show", "work", "farm", "owner", "whose", "produc", "ripe", "unpick", "a", "scientist", "ask", "mexican", "disappear", "volunt", "genet", "experi", "femal", "newscast", "daughter", "musician", "mai", "miss", "link", "around", "why", "and", "mexican", "gone", "even", "border", "guard", "griev", "the", "state", "economi", "grind", "halt"], "tmdb_score_value": 4.9, "tmdb_score_count": 17, "imdb_score_value": 4.7, "imdb_score_count": 2910, "meta_score_value": 30.0, "meta_score_count": 11}
