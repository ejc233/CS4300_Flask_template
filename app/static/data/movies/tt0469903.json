Schwartzwalder recruits Davis with the help of All-American running back, Jim Brown. The civil rights movement is gaining steam; Davis experiences prejudice on campus, in town, and on the field, sometimes from teammates. How he handles it and how he challenges Schwartzwalder to stand up for his players provide a counterpoint to several great seasons that lead first to a national championship and then to the Heismann Trophy.", "tmdb_score_value": 7.1, "tmdb_score_count": 85, "imdb_score_value": 7.3, "imdb_score_count": 17949, "meta_score_value": 58.0, "meta_score_count": 27}
