In his village, Bil'in, a separation barrier is being built and the villagers start to resist this decision. For more than five years, Emad films the struggle, which is led by two of his best friends, alongside filming how Gibreel grows. Very soon it affects his family and his own life. Daily arrests and night raids scare his family; his friends, brothers and himself are either shot or arrested. One camera after another is shot at or smashed. Each of the 5 cameras tells part of his story.", "tokens": ["when", "fourth", "son", "gibreel", "born", "emad", "palestinian", "villag", "get", "first", "camera", "in", "villag", "bil", "separ", "barrier", "built", "villag", "start", "resist", "decis", "for", "five", "year", "emad", "film", "struggl", "led", "two", "best", "friend", "alongsid", "film", "gibreel", "grow", "veri", "soon", "affect", "famili", "life", "daili", "arrest", "night", "raid", "scare", "famili", "friend", "brother", "either", "shot", "arrest", "on", "camera", "anoth", "shot", "smash", "each", "5", "camera", "tell", "part", "stori"], "tmdb_score_value": 7.6, "tmdb_score_count": 36, "imdb_score_value": 8.0, "imdb_score_count": 5299, "meta_score_value": 78.0, "meta_score_count": 15}
