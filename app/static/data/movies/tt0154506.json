One day, a glib and self-confident man whom Bill has been following confronts him. He's Cobb, a burglar who takes Bill under his wing and shows him how to break and enter. They burgle a woman's flat; Bill gets intrigued with her (photographs are everywhere in her flat). He follows her and chats her up at a bar owned by her ex-boyfriend, a nasty piece of work who killed someone in her living room with a hammer. Soon Bill is volunteering to do her a favor, which involves a break-in. What does the older man know that Bill doesn't?", "tmdb_score_value": 7.2, "tmdb_score_count": 468, "imdb_score_value": 7.6, "imdb_score_count": 74345, "meta_score_value": 60.0, "meta_score_count": 11}
