She drags his reasons out of him little by little and tries to sympathize. Keenly feeling the loss of his love, She flies to Havana to sort things out on the beach and in the cabarets. She sends him a ticket, but harbors no illusions that He will join her in this Carribean melting pot...", "tokens": ["in", "film", "told", "almost", "entir", "iambic", "pentamet", "she", "scientist", "loveless", "marriag", "anthoni", "deviou", "politician", "he", "lebanes", "doctor", "self", "impos", "exil", "work", "chef", "london", "restaur", "thei", "meet", "banquet", "fall", "carefre", "passion", "relationship", "but", "contempt", "he", "perceiv", "muslim", "immigr", "uk", "caus", "break", "she", "offer", "littl", "wai", "explan", "return", "homeland", "she", "drag", "reason", "littl", "littl", "tri", "sympath", "keenli", "feel", "loss", "love", "she", "fli", "havana", "sort", "thing", "beach", "cabaret", "she", "send", "ticket", "harbor", "illus", "he", "join", "carribean", "melt", "pot"], "tmdb_score_value": 6.0, "tmdb_score_count": 8, "imdb_score_value": 6.8, "imdb_score_count": 2843, "meta_score_value": 55.0, "meta_score_count": 29}
