After fifteen years in exile, Benjamin returns to London under the new identity of Sweeney Todd, seeking revenge against Turpin. He meets the widow Mrs. Lovett who is the owner of a meat pie shop who tells him that Lucy swallowed arsenic many years ago, and Turpin assigned himself tutor of Johanna. He opens a barber shop above her store, initiating a crime rampage against those who made him suffer and lose his beloved family.", "tmdb_score_value": 7.0, "tmdb_score_count": 2300, "imdb_score_value": 7.4, "imdb_score_count": 308564, "meta_score_value": 83.0, "meta_score_count": 39}
