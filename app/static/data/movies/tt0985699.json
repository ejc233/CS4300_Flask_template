To this end, Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, an Army officer convinced he must save Germany from Hitler, is recruited to mastermind a real plan. To do so, he arranges for the internal emergency measure, Operation: Valkyrie, to be changed to enable his fellows to seize control of Berlin after the assassination of the Fuhrer. However, even as the plan is put into action, a combination of bad luck and human failings conspire on their own to create a tragedy that would prolong the greater one gripping Europe.", "tmdb_score_value": 6.7, "tmdb_score_count": 1478, "imdb_score_value": 7.1, "imdb_score_count": 202923, "meta_score_value": 56.0, "meta_score_count": 36}
