Brokering the incident for political capital, Shaw eventually becomes a vice-presidential nominee, while Marco is haunted by dreams of what happened -- or didn't happen -- in Kuwait. As Marco (now a Major) investigates, the story begins to unravel, to the point where he questions if it happened at all. Is it possible the entire unit was kidnapped and brainwashed to believe Shaw is a war hero as part of a plot to seize the White House? Some very powerful people at Manchurian Global corporation appear desperate to stop him from finding out.", "tmdb_score_value": 6.2, "tmdb_score_count": 529, "imdb_score_value": 6.6, "imdb_score_count": 93260, "meta_score_value": 76.0, "meta_score_count": 41}
