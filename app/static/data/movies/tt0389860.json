Problem is he gets less time with his family, and wishes for a remote in which he can control his life. This soon comes true for Newman, when he meets Morty (Walken), a crazy sales clerk, who has the ultimate remote. A remote in which he can do anything, including muting, skipping and dubbing his life. He finds this to be the opportunity in which he can not only skip every argument, but also skip to his promotion. He sees this as a good idea, until the remote goes horribly wrong.", "tmdb_score_value": 6.0, "tmdb_score_count": 2779, "imdb_score_value": 6.4, "imdb_score_count": 270123, "meta_score_value": 45.0, "meta_score_count": 35}
