But that all changes when a misfit inventor ant named Flik accidentally knocks over the offering pile thus forcing the grasshoppers' devious leader Hopper to force the ants to redo their gathering of food. Despite the fact that his friends don't believe him and desperate to help save the colony, Flik volunteers to go out into the world and search for a group of 'warrior' bugs. Instead, what he got was a talented group of circus performers. But when the grasshoppers return and take control of the island, Flik must prove himself a true hero before it's too late.", "tmdb_score_value": 6.8, "tmdb_score_count": 3267, "imdb_score_value": 7.2, "imdb_score_count": 233528, "meta_score_value": 77.0, "meta_score_count": 23}
