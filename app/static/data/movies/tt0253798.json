The late founder, Papa Muntz, was famed for skiing with his butt exposed, and in fact is so memorialized by a statue. But his son, Ted, plans to sell the resort to hotshot ski mogul John Majors, who starts turning it into a slick resort, which of course has no room for most of the staff. The exception is Rick, the most serious of the bunch. But there's a complication: Rick met Majors' stepdaughter Anna on vacation in Mexico, and he's never gotten over a crush he had on her, even though she's about to marry a great guy, and Rick is also fiercely loyal to his friends.", "tmdb_score_value": 5.8, "tmdb_score_count": 62, "imdb_score_value": 6.3, "imdb_score_count": 15360, "meta_score_value": 22.0, "meta_score_count": 15}
