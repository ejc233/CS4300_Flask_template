The ultimate version, Slayers, fields death row convicts as gladiators in a desperate dim bid for survival, which no-one made yet. The champion, John 'Kable' Tillman, was scheduled to die just before he'ld gain release, but he persuades his teenage 'handler' to hand over the reins so he can fully use his talents and experience. Thus Kable escapes to freedom, only to be chased illegally by Castle's men, yet fights back all the way to his HQ and challenges his evil hidden plans.", "tmdb_score_value": 5.6, "tmdb_score_count": 940, "imdb_score_value": 5.8, "imdb_score_count": 120629, "meta_score_value": 27.0, "meta_score_count": 13}
