Moving to the big city, Deeds finds himself besieged by opportunists all gunning for their piece of the pie. Babe, a television tabloid reporter, poses as an innocent small-town girl to do an expos\u00e9 on Deeds. Of course, Deeds' sincere naivet\u00e9 has Babe falling in love with him instead. Ultimately, Deeds comes to find that money truly has the power to change things, but it doesn't necessarily need to change him.", "tmdb_score_value": 5.6, "tmdb_score_count": 842, "imdb_score_value": 5.8, "imdb_score_count": 121015, "meta_score_value": 24.0, "meta_score_count": 33}
