After failing to find protection from the American embassy and the French police, a despairing Andr\u00e9 scrambles onto a bridge over the Seine, intending to leap to his death. He is surprised to see a tall, beautiful girl clinging to a rail on the same bridge, apparently preparing to end her life as well. She jumps, and he jumps too, suddenly resolving to save her life. After scrambling ashore, she tells him her name is Angel-A. Together, they take a cruise on the Seine, repay Andr\u00e9's creditors, visit a Parisian nightspot, and more, as Angel-A helps Andr\u00e9. He learns that for this purpose she has fallen out of the sky and into his life. Andr\u00e9 finds himself falling in love with this mysterious beauty.", "tmdb_score_value": 6.7, "tmdb_score_count": 227, "imdb_score_value": 7.1, "imdb_score_count": 28718, "meta_score_value": 48.0, "meta_score_count": 25}
