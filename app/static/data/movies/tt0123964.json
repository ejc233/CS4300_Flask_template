They'd served 65 years for a murder they didn't commit, framed by a local sheriff while buying moonshine whiskey for a Manhattan club owner to whom they owed money. In flashbacks we see this odd couple thrown together (Ray is a fast-talking con man, and Claude is a serious man about to start work as a bank teller), the loss of Ray's watch (sterling silver, from his daddy), the murder and trial, the hardships of Parchman, and the love-hate relationship of Claude and Ray as they spend 65 years bickering and looking for a way to escape.", "tmdb_score_value": 6.4, "tmdb_score_count": 221, "imdb_score_value": 6.7, "imdb_score_count": 37550, "meta_score_value": 63.0, "meta_score_count": 20}
