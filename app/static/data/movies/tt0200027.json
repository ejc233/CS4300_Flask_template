From an early age, Beverly displays a keen intelligence and an interest in literature, and dreams of going to college in New York and becoming a writer. However, she also develops an early interest in boys, and at 15 finds herself madly in love with a boy from her high school. However, an attempt to get his attention leads to an embarassing incident at a party, and Ray, a sweet but thick-headed 18-year-old, steps forward to defend her. Beverly and Ray end up making out, and after one thing leads to another, Beverly discovers she's pregnant. Telling Ray is only marginally less difficult...", "tmdb_score_value": 6.5, "tmdb_score_count": 141, "imdb_score_value": 6.5, "imdb_score_count": 24357, "meta_score_value": 43.0, "meta_score_count": 31}
