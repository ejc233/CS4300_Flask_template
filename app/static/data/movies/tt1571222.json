Spielrain's psychological problems are deeply rooted in her childhood and violent father. She is highly intelligent however and hopes to be a doctor, eventually becoming a psychiatrist in her own right. The married Jung and Spielrein eventually become lovers. Jung and Freud develop an almost father-son relationship with Freud seeing the young Jung as his likely successor as the standard-bearer of his beliefs. A deep rift develops between them when Jung diverges from Freud's belief that while psychoanalysis can reveal the cause of psychological problems it cannot cure the patient.", "tmdb_score_value": 6.2, "tmdb_score_count": 771, "imdb_score_value": 6.5, "imdb_score_count": 89239, "meta_score_value": 76.0, "meta_score_count": 41}
