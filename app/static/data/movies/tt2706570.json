Then he gets out and mows the lawn, where he accidentally cuts the mower's power cord when he runs over it. Set on fixing it, he goes to find tools but stumbles across a gun that he brings back to his room to shoot himself twice. But Mariano survives: one bullet just grazed his head and the other one, he believes, is stuck somewhere inside his body even if the doctors can't find it anywhere, nor any exit wound for that matter. The only after effect he seems to have is a mysterious double-note when he plays music with his friends, which according to him is probably the result of the bullet still being inside him. But Mariano's impulsive act will have other consequences on the people surrounding him.", "tokens": ["on", "earli", "morn", "begin", "hot", "summer", "mariano", "17", "year", "old", "teenag", "return", "home", "jump", "pool", "lap", "stopwatch", "then", "get", "mow", "lawn", "accident", "cut", "mower", "power", "cord", "run", "set", "fix", "goe", "find", "tool", "stumbl", "across", "gun", "bring", "back", "room", "shoot", "twice", "but", "mariano", "surviv", "on", "bullet", "graze", "head", "on", "believ", "stuck", "somewher", "insid", "bodi", "even", "doctor", "find", "anywher", "exit", "wound", "matter", "the", "effect", "seem", "mysteri", "doubl", "note", "plai", "music", "friend", "accord", "probabl", "result", "bullet", "still", "insid", "but", "mariano", "impuls", "act", "consequ", "peopl", "surround"], "tmdb_score_value": 6.7, "tmdb_score_count": 3, "imdb_score_value": 6.2, "imdb_score_count": 290, "meta_score_value": 46.0, "meta_score_count": 4}
