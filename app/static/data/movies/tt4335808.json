After the regime fell from power in 2001, a fledgling free press emerged and a photography revolution was born. Now, as foreign troops and media withdraw, Afghanistan is left to stand on its own, and so are its journalists. Set in a modern Afghanistan bursting with color and character, FRAME BY FRAME follows four Afghan photojournalists as they navigate an emerging and dangerous media landscape reframing Afghanistan for the world, and for themselves. Through cinema v\u00e9rit\u00e9, intimate interviews, powerful photojournalism, and never-before-seen archival footage shot in secret during the Taliban regime, the film connects audiences with four humans in the pursuit of the truth.", "tokens": ["when", "taliban", "rule", "afghanistan", "take", "photo", "crime", "after", "regim", "fell", "power", "2001", "fledgl", "free", "press", "emerg", "photographi", "revolut", "born", "now", "foreign", "troop", "media", "withdraw", "afghanistan", "left", "stand", "journalist", "set", "modern", "afghanistan", "burst", "color", "charact", "frame", "by", "frame", "follow", "four", "afghan", "photojournalist", "navig", "emerg", "danger", "media", "landscap", "refram", "afghanistan", "world", "through", "cinema", "v\u00e9rit\u00e9", "intim", "interview", "power", "photojourn", "never", "seen", "archiv", "footag", "shot", "secret", "taliban", "regim", "film", "connect", "audienc", "four", "human", "pursuit", "truth"], "tmdb_score_value": 0.0, "tmdb_score_count": 0, "imdb_score_value": 8.1, "imdb_score_count": 97, "meta_score_value": 84.0, "meta_score_count": 5}
