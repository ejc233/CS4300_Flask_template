But through his Extreme Ice Survey, he discovers undeniable evidence of our changing planet. In 'Chasing Ice,' we follow Balog across the Arctic as he deploys revolutionary time-lapse cameras designed for one purpose: to capture a multi-year record of the world's changing glaciers. Balog's hauntingly beautiful videos compress years into seconds and capture ancient mountains of ice in motion as they disappear at a breathtaking rate. Traveling with a young team of adventurers by helicopter, canoe and dog sled across three continents, Balog risks his career and his well-being in pursuit of the biggest story in human history. As the debate polarizes America and the intensity of natural disasters ramp up around the world, 'Chasing Ice' depicts a heroic photojournalist on a mission to gather evidence and deliver hope to our carbon-powered planet", "tokens": ["nation", "geograph", "photograph", "jame", "balog", "skeptic", "climat", "chang", "but", "extrem", "ic", "survei", "discov", "undeni", "evid", "chang", "planet", "in", "chase", "ic", "follow", "balog", "across", "arctic", "deploi", "revolutionari", "time", "laps", "camera", "design", "on", "purpos", "captur", "multi", "year", "record", "world", "chang", "glacier", "balog", "hauntingli", "beauti", "video", "compress", "year", "second", "captur", "ancient", "mountain", "ic", "motion", "disappear", "breathtak", "rate", "travel", "young", "team", "adventur", "helicopt", "cano", "dog", "sled", "across", "three", "contin", "balog", "risk", "career", "well", "pursuit", "biggest", "stori", "human", "histori", "as", "debat", "polar", "america", "intens", "natur", "disast", "ramp", "around", "world", "chase", "ic", "depict", "heroic", "photojournalist", "mission", "gather", "evid", "deliv", "hope", "carbon", "power", "planet"], "tmdb_score_value": 7.4, "tmdb_score_count": 79, "imdb_score_value": 7.8, "imdb_score_count": 7282, "meta_score_value": 75.0, "meta_score_count": 15}
