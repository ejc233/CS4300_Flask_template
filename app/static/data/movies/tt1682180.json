The solitude of her woodsy family estate, the peace of her tranquil town, and the unspoken somberness of her home life are suddenly upended by not only this mysterious accident, but by the sudden arrival of her Uncle Charlie , who she never knew existed. When Charlie moves in with her and her emotionally unstable mother Evie , India thinks the void left by her father's death is finally being filled by his closest bloodline. Soon after his arrival, India comes to suspect that this mysterious, charming man has ulterior motives. Yet instead of feeling outrage or horror, this friendless young woman becomes increasingly infatuated with him.", "tmdb_score_value": 6.5, "tmdb_score_count": 1052, "imdb_score_value": 6.8, "imdb_score_count": 93257, "meta_score_value": 58.0, "meta_score_count": 42}
