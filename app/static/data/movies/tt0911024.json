Venkatesh is 18, illiterate; he cleans hotel rooms in Panjim, Goa, and sells plastic bags on the street with his 10-year-old partner, Jhangir, an enterprising orphan. He's fascinated by the swimming pool on a vacant estate, and when the owner shows up from Bombay with his teen daughter, Venkatesh watches them from a tree and follows the girl when she's out. He and Jhangir start a friendship with her. The father and daughter are at odds, hardly speaking; tragedy is in their past. Venkatesh helps the father in the garden; short, odd conversations evolve into a gruff offering of a job and schooling in Bombay. What will Venkatesh do with this opportunity?", "tokens": ["come", "ag", "venkatesh", "18", "illiter", "clean", "hotel", "room", "panjim", "goa", "sell", "plastic", "bag", "street", "10", "year", "old", "partner", "jhangir", "enterpris", "orphan", "he", "fascin", "swim", "pool", "vacant", "estat", "owner", "show", "bombai", "teen", "daughter", "venkatesh", "watch", "tree", "follow", "girl", "he", "jhangir", "start", "friendship", "the", "father", "daughter", "odd", "hardli", "speak", "tragedi", "past", "venkatesh", "help", "father", "garden", "short", "odd", "convers", "evolv", "gruff", "offer", "job", "school", "bombai", "what", "venkatesh", "opportun"], "tmdb_score_value": 6.8, "tmdb_score_count": 5, "imdb_score_value": 7.0, "imdb_score_count": 748, "meta_score_value": 77.0, "meta_score_count": 20}
