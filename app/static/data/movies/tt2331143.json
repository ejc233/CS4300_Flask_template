Ryota is forced to make a life-changing decision, to choose between 'nature' and 'nurture.' Seeing Midori's devotion to Keita even after learning his origin, and communicating with the rough yet caring family that has raised his natural son for the last six years, Ryota also starts to question himself: has he really been a 'father' all these years....", "tmdb_score_value": 7.6, "tmdb_score_count": 152, "imdb_score_value": 7.8, "imdb_score_count": 15430, "meta_score_value": 73.0, "meta_score_count": 33}
