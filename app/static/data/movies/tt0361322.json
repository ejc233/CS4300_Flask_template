Todd's detachment from his surroundings is compromised only by his unlikely friendship with Mrs. Pearlman, a resident who begins to confuse him with her son. On this particular day, Todd must choose whether or not to play the part. \"Assisted Living\" is shot and staged in a real nursing home and gains much of its unique effect and style from the participation of actual residents and staff members. During much of the film, it is impossible to distinguish between what is real and what is fiction.", "tokens": ["assist", "live", "chronicl", "dai", "life", "todd", "janitor", "spend", "dai", "smoke", "pot", "interact", "resid", "entertain", "todd", "detach", "surround", "compromis", "unlik", "friendship", "mr", "pearlman", "resid", "begin", "confus", "son", "on", "particular", "dai", "todd", "must", "choos", "whether", "plai", "part", "assist", "live", "shot", "stage", "real", "nurs", "home", "gain", "much", "uniqu", "effect", "style", "particip", "actual", "resid", "staff", "member", "dure", "much", "film", "imposs", "distinguish", "real", "fiction"], "tmdb_score_value": 7.5, "tmdb_score_count": 1, "imdb_score_value": 6.7, "imdb_score_count": 264, "meta_score_value": 57.0, "meta_score_count": 19}
