One night he surprises an intruder , who turns out to be a kid, almost 8 years old. There's something oddly familiar about the chubby lad, whose name is Rusty. The boy's identity sparks a journey into Russ's past that the two of them take - to find the key moment that has defined who Russ is. Two long-suffering women look on with disbelief: Russ's secretary, Janet, and his assistant, the lovely Amy, to whom Rusty takes a shine. What, and who, is at the end of this journey?", "tmdb_score_value": 6.0, "tmdb_score_count": 309, "imdb_score_value": 6.1, "imdb_score_count": 36738, "meta_score_value": 45.0, "meta_score_count": 32}
