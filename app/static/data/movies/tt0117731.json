Witnessing the loss of the battle, Captain Jean-Luc Picard ignores orders and takes command of the fleet engaging the Borg. But the Borg plan to travel back into the 21st century through a vortex with the intention to stop Earth's first contact with an alien race (the Vulcans). Following the Borg sphere, Picard and his crew realize that they have taken over the Enterprise in order to carry out their mission. Their only chance to do away with the Borg and their seductive queen is to make sure that Zefram Cochrane makes his famous faster-than-light travel to the stars.", "tmdb_score_value": 7.1, "tmdb_score_count": 782, "imdb_score_value": 7.6, "imdb_score_count": 105698, "meta_score_value": 71.0, "meta_score_count": 18}
