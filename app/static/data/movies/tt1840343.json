It was made during his summer 2009 tour with Bob Dylan and Willie Nelson; Mellencamp also recorded his new album in three historical locations during the month and a half tour. The story is told through the eyes of the father/son film making team of Kurt and Ian Markus, neither of whom had ever made a film before. The entire 90-minute film is shot on super8, to stunning effect. This is not a retrospective film with interviews. It is of the moment.", "tokens": ["thi", "person", "journei", "film", "singer/songwrit", "john", "mellencamp", "it", "made", "summer", "2009", "tour", "bob", "dylan", "willi", "nelson", "mellencamp", "also", "record", "new", "album", "three", "histor", "locat", "month", "half", "tour", "the", "stori", "told", "ey", "father/son", "film", "make", "team", "kurt", "ian", "marku", "neither", "ever", "made", "film", "the", "entir", "90", "minut", "film", "shot", "super8", "stun", "effect", "sever", "photograph", "still", "insert", "throughout", "thi", "retrospect", "film", "interview", "it", "moment"], "tmdb_score_value": 0.0, "tmdb_score_count": 0, "imdb_score_value": 5.2, "imdb_score_count": 34, "meta_score_value": 55.0, "meta_score_count": 11}
