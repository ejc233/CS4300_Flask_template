A quiet, guarded man, Walter finds unexpected solace from Vickie, a tough-talking woman who promises not to judge him for his history. But Walter cannot escape his past. A convicted sex offender, Walter is warily eyed by his brother-in-law, shunned by his sister, lives in fear of being discovered at work, and is hounded by a suspicious local police officer, Detective Lucas. After befriending a young girl in a neighborhood park, Walter must also grapple with the terrible prospect of his own reawakened demons.", "tmdb_score_value": 6.8, "tmdb_score_count": 136, "imdb_score_value": 7.2, "imdb_score_count": 29376, "meta_score_value": 72.0, "meta_score_count": 34}
