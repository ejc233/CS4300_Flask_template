Cobain's death was ruled a suicide by the police (a reported self-inflicted gunshot wound), but doubts have circulated for twenty years as to the legitimacy of this ruling, especially due to the work of Mr. Grant, a former L.A. County Sheriff's detective, who did his own investigation and determined there was significant empirical and circumstantial evidence to conclude that foul play could very well have occurred. The film develops as a narrative mystery with cinematic re-creations, interviews with key experts and witnesses and the examination of official artifacts from the 1994 case.", "tokens": ["soak", "in", "bleach", "reveal", "event", "behind", "kurt", "cobain", "death", "seen", "ey", "tom", "grant", "privat", "investig", "hire", "courtnei", "love", "1994", "track", "miss", "husband", "kurt", "cobain", "dai", "deceas", "bodi", "found", "seattl", "home", "cobain", "death", "rule", "suicid", "polic", "report", "self", "inflict", "gunshot", "wound", "doubt", "circul", "twenti", "year", "legitimaci", "rule", "especi", "due", "work", "mr", "grant", "former", "l", "a", "counti", "sheriff", "detect", "investig", "determin", "signific", "empir", "circumstanti", "evid", "conclud", "foul", "plai", "could", "well", "occur", "the", "film", "develop", "narr", "mysteri", "cinemat", "creation", "interview", "kei", "expert", "wit", "examin", "offici", "artifact", "1994", "case", "come", "soon", "2014"], "tmdb_score_value": 7.1, "tmdb_score_count": 94, "imdb_score_value": 7.5, "imdb_score_count": 11408, "meta_score_value": 50.0, "meta_score_count": 7}
