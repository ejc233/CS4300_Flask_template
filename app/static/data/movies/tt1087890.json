He quickly learns that the town bully, J\u00f8rgen, beats his wife, an outsider like Robert. He tries to get her to swear out a complaint against J\u00f8rgen; she flirts with Robert. When someone dies and Robert knows the prime suspect is innocent, he halts vigilante justice and things get complicated. He wants to protect himself and the daughter of J\u00f8rgen, and he wants to reconnect with his own daughter back home. Is rural justice his ticket back to Copenhagen? Is there any chance at happiness?", "tokens": ["robert", "hansen", "cop", "copenhagen", "make", "mistak", "remand", "therapi", "assign", "small", "town", "south", "jutland", "cow", "problem", "disappear", "mud", "he", "quickli", "learn", "town", "bulli", "j\u00f8rgen", "beat", "wife", "outsid", "like", "robert", "he", "tri", "get", "swear", "complaint", "j\u00f8rgen", "flirt", "robert", "when", "someon", "di", "robert", "know", "prime", "suspect", "innoc", "halt", "vigilant", "justic", "thing", "get", "complic", "he", "want", "protect", "daughter", "j\u00f8rgen", "want", "reconnect", "daughter", "back", "home", "is", "rural", "justic", "ticket", "back", "copenhagen", "is", "chanc", "happi", "written", "<jhailey@hotmail", "com>"], "tmdb_score_value": 6.3, "tmdb_score_count": 28, "imdb_score_value": 6.9, "imdb_score_count": 4759, "meta_score_value": 74.0, "meta_score_count": 18}
