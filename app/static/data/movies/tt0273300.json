He's late, she's gone on to Niagara Falls, so he has two days, traveling slowly and reluctantly, to get to the wedding. At the airport, he meets Alicia, a lively Latin, going with her boyfriend to see her family. George is smitten. Partly by happenstance, and partly by the designs of Gerard, a romantic and manic Frenchman George meets at the airport, his path crosses Alicia's a few times. As Gerard puts it, George should seize the chance to see what happens with Alicia - he can always jump tomorrow. Can George take on fate and custom?", "tokens": ["georg", "passiv", "sometim", "expressionless", "nigerian", "arriv", "buffalo", "airport", "meet", "women", "famili", "arrang", "marri", "he", "late", "gone", "niagara", "fall", "two", "dai", "travel", "slowli", "reluctantli", "get", "wed", "at", "airport", "meet", "alicia", "live", "latin", "go", "boyfriend", "see", "famili", "georg", "smitten", "partli", "happenst", "partli", "design", "gerard", "romant", "manic", "frenchman", "georg", "meet", "airport", "path", "cross", "alicia", "time", "as", "gerard", "put", "georg", "seiz", "chanc", "see", "happen", "alicia", "alwai", "jump", "tomorrow", "can", "georg", "take", "fate", "custom"], "tmdb_score_value": 6.4, "tmdb_score_count": 9, "imdb_score_value": 7.3, "imdb_score_count": 1294, "meta_score_value": 68.0, "meta_score_count": 21}
