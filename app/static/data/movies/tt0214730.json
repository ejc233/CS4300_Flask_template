Rising with xenophobia with Mexican immigration and their taste for smoking marijuana, we see the establishment of a wrong headed federal drug policy as a crime issue as opposed to a public health approach. Fueled by prejudice, hysterical propaganda and political opportunism undeterred by voices of reason on the subject, we follow the story of a costly and futile crusade against a substance with debatable ill effects that has damaged basic civil liberties.", "tokens": ["a", "truth", "look", "histori", "marijuana", "posit", "neg", "impact", "societi", "it", "also", "cover", "drug", "war", "start", "presid", "name", "reagan", "squander", "fund", "order", "rid", "world", "believ", "danger", "it", "span", "introduct", "american", "societi", "cover", "present", "1999"], "tmdb_score_value": 6.6, "tmdb_score_count": 12, "imdb_score_value": 7.3, "imdb_score_count": 3355, "meta_score_value": 64.0, "meta_score_count": 19}
