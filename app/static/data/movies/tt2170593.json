Things change when his new next-door neighbor's son, Oliver, needs a babysitter and Vince is willing enough for a fee. From that self-serving act, an unexpected friendship forms as Vincent and Oliver find so much of each other's needs through each other. As Vincent mentors Oliver in street survival and other worldly ways, Oliver begins to see more in the old man than just his foibles. When life takes a turn for the worse for Vincent, both them find the best in each other than no one around them suspects.", "tmdb_score_value": 7.1, "tmdb_score_count": 894, "imdb_score_value": 7.3, "imdb_score_count": 85116, "meta_score_value": 64.0, "meta_score_count": 40}
