Vincent fabricates a new job for himself so his family and friends will not know that he is out of work. At one point, he even sneaks into an office building. As Vincent roams the building's sterile halls, peeking into meeting rooms where men are busy at work, we see a man who yearns not just for a new job, but also for a place in the world. While this pantomime of work initially registers as sad and even a little pathetic, it slowly and unnervingly becomes terrifying.", "tokens": ["recent", "fire", "job", "unabl", "confess", "truth", "close", "knit", "famili", "vincent", "spend", "dai", "drive", "around", "countrysid", "talk", "cell", "phone", "stare", "space", "vincent", "fabric", "new", "job", "famili", "friend", "know", "work", "at", "on", "point", "even", "sneak", "offic", "build", "as", "vincent", "roam", "build", "steril", "hall", "peek", "meet", "room", "men", "busi", "work", "see", "man", "yearn", "new", "job", "also", "place", "world", "while", "pantomim", "work", "initi", "regist", "sad", "even", "littl", "pathet", "slowli", "unnervingli", "becom", "terrifi"], "tmdb_score_value": 6.0, "tmdb_score_count": 24, "imdb_score_value": 7.4, "imdb_score_count": 4377, "meta_score_value": 88.0, "meta_score_count": 30}
