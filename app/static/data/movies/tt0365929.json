An incident from her past haunts her. The continent's first winter storm is coming when a body, wearing no gear, is discovered in the tundra. She investigates, soon finds more bodies, and must find a motive and a murderer before the storm and her departure. A U.N. agent, Robert Pryce, appears, seemingly out of nowhere, to help. An aging physician about to retire, a nervous mission chief, a downed Soviet plane, and the weather's deadly elements add to the story. Can Carrie trust Pryce and does she still have what it takes?", "tmdb_score_value": 5.4, "tmdb_score_count": 278, "imdb_score_value": 5.5, "imdb_score_count": 34248, "meta_score_value": 0.0, "meta_score_count": 0}
