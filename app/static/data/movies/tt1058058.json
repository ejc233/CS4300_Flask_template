In present-day interviews, Larry's family talks about him, while writers, reporters, and clients talk about the club. Mixed with these interviews are still photographs and archival footage of the club, Larry's appearances on talk shows, and newspaper articles. By the late 70s, the club was in full swing, with talk of Plato's Retreats in other cities. By the end of the decade, tax problems had Larry in trouble with the IRS and changing mores gave the club a different vibe. Then AIDS became an epidemic.", "tokens": ["the", "parallel", "stori", "plato", "retreat", "manhattan", "sex", "club", "straight", "coupl", "oper", "1977", "mid", "1980", "larri", "levenson", "club", "impresario", "in", "present", "dai", "interview", "larri", "famili", "talk", "writer", "report", "client", "talk", "club", "mix", "interview", "still", "photograph", "archiv", "footag", "club", "larri", "appear", "talk", "show", "newspap", "articl", "by", "late", "70", "club", "full", "swing", "talk", "plato", "retreat", "citi", "by", "end", "decad", "tax", "problem", "larri", "troubl", "ir", "chang", "more", "gave", "club", "differ", "vibe", "then", "aid", "becam", "epidem"], "tmdb_score_value": 4.3, "tmdb_score_count": 5, "imdb_score_value": 6.2, "imdb_score_count": 532, "meta_score_value": 59.0, "meta_score_count": 9}
