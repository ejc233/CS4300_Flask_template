Chief among the purveyors of this literature was Bob Mizer, who maintained a magazine and developed sexually inexplicit men's films for over 40 years. Aided by his mother, the two maintained a stable of not so innocent studs. At the end, the film moves into a court room drama as Mizer is tried for running a male-prostitute ring in the early 60's. Clips of Mizer's actual films starring individuals, such as Jack LaLanne and Joe Dallesandro, are included.", "tokens": ["thi", "film", "look", "1950", "muscl", "men", "magazin", "repres", "industri", "popular", "supposedli", "health", "fit", "magazin", "realiti", "primarili", "purchas", "still", "underground", "homosexu", "commun", "chief", "among", "purveyor", "literatur", "bob", "mizer", "maintain", "magazin", "develop", "sexual", "inexplicit", "men", "film", "40", "year", "aid", "mother", "two", "maintain", "stabl", "innoc", "stud", "at", "end", "film", "move", "court", "room", "drama", "mizer", "tri", "run", "male", "prostitut", "ring", "earli", "60", "clip", "mizer", "actual", "film", "star", "individu", "jack", "lalann", "joe", "dallesandro", "includ"], "tmdb_score_value": 4.6, "tmdb_score_count": 10, "imdb_score_value": 6.8, "imdb_score_count": 875, "meta_score_value": 52.0, "meta_score_count": 15}
