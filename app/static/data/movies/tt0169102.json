They are already taxed to the bone by the British and their cronies, but when Jack Russell announces that he will double the Lagaan (tax) from all villagers, they decide to oppose it.

As the challenge is accepted, the interest grows and attracts Indians from all over the region, as well as the British from all over the country - as everyone gathers to see the 'fair play' that the British will display against their counter-parts, who are aided by none other than the sister, Elizabeth, of Captain Rusell.", "tmdb_score_value": 7.2, "tmdb_score_count": 169, "imdb_score_value": 8.2, "imdb_score_count": 85829, "meta_score_value": 84.0, "meta_score_count": 21}
