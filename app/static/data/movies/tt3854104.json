Struggling to cope with past sexual trauma and the daily aggressions of a what she perceives as a male-dominated society, she creates grotesquely costumed alter egos that re-appropriate the male form. While giving her the sense of power she craves, acting as these characters pushes her further into a world of her own making. When she begins a new relationship with a seemingly good guy, she opens herself up to him - but that vulnerability comes at a dangerous cost, and her alter egos threaten to lash out in explosive violence. Based on the real experiences and art of co-writer/star Amy Everson, Felt doesn't just point a finger at rape culture; it takes a full on swing at it, creating a feminist psychological thriller that audiences will be hard-pressed to shake off.", "tokens": ["ami", "hang", "thread", "struggl", "cope", "past", "sexual", "trauma", "daili", "aggress", "perceiv", "male", "domin", "societi", "creat", "grotesqu", "costum", "alter", "ego", "appropri", "male", "form", "while", "give", "sens", "power", "crave", "act", "charact", "push", "world", "make", "when", "begin", "new", "relationship", "seemingli", "good", "gui", "open", "vulner", "come", "danger", "cost", "alter", "ego", "threaten", "lash", "explos", "violenc", "base", "real", "experi", "art", "co", "writer/star", "ami", "everson", "felt", "point", "finger", "rape", "cultur", "take", "full", "swing", "creat", "feminist", "psycholog", "thriller", "audienc", "hard", "press", "shake"], "tmdb_score_value": 5.0, "tmdb_score_count": 11, "imdb_score_value": 4.6, "imdb_score_count": 755, "meta_score_value": 54.0, "meta_score_count": 10}
