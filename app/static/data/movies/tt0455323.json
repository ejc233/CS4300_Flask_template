Around the time he takes a job at a homeless shelter in Boston, his father, Jonathan, who considers himself a great writer and who hasn't see Nick in years, abruptly makes fleeting contact. A few months later, the down-and-out Jonathan shows up at Nick's shelter and becomes a resident. This disorients Nick; he doesn't handle it well, compounded by Jonathan's belligerent behavior. Nick's memories of his mother, his budding relationship with a co-worker, and his own demons make things worse. Can anything improve? Is he his father's son?", "tokens": ["the", "true", "stori", "complex", "father/son", "relationship", "nick", "dad", "jonathan", "dure", "twenti", "nick", "work", "variou", "homeless", "shelter", "boston", "often", "intersect", "brilliant", "troubl", "father", "hi", "father", "reach", "unexpectedli", "nick", "mother", "di", "begin", "new", "relationship", "girl", "denis", "the", "last", "person", "want", "see", "father", "but", "outrun", "fate", "slowli", "nick", "come", "realiz", "given", "chanc", "make", "real", "futur", "struggl", "father"], "tmdb_score_value": 5.9, "tmdb_score_count": 98, "imdb_score_value": 6.4, "imdb_score_count": 15169, "meta_score_value": 53.0, "meta_score_count": 27}
