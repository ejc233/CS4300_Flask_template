Shortz actually has a university degree in games and organized the first crossword championship in 1978. Some of the contributors to the Times puzzle explain how they go about building them while some aficionados, including former President Bill Clinton and comedian Jon Stewart talk about their love of solving them. The film also introduces several past champions and near champions competing in the 2006 tournament and it takes you from the preliminary rounds to the final where the top three contestants compete in front of a room full of admiring contestants.", "tokens": ["documentari", "crossword", "competit", "creat", "will", "shortz", "new", "york", "time", "n", "p", "r", "altern", "finalist", "averag", "folk", "extraordinari", "abil", "cross", "word", "puzzl", "quickli", "well", "famou", "peopl", "love", "cross", "word", "the", "famou", "folk", "includ", "former", "presid", "bill", "clinton", "film", "maker", "ken", "burn", "n", "y", "time", "editor", "daniel", "okrent", "daili", "show", "host", "jon", "stewart", "the", "central", "conceit", "annual", "american", "crossword", "puzzl", "tournament", "held", "everi", "year", "stamford", "connecticut", "denoument", "film", "final", "round", "crown", "champion", "puzzl", "solver"], "tmdb_score_value": 7.4, "tmdb_score_count": 13, "imdb_score_value": 7.4, "imdb_score_count": 3488, "meta_score_value": 73.0, "meta_score_count": 35}
