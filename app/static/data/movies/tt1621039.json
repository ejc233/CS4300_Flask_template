However, Reggie's easy life is disrupted by Jake, a fanatic turkey who drags him along with the insane idea of going back in time to make sure turkeys are not part of the first Thanksgiving. Through foolhardiness and luck, the pair manage to take an experimental time machine to do just that. Now in 1621 at the Plymouth colony, Reggie and Jake find themselves in the middle of a turkey clan's struggle for survival. In doing so, their preconceptions of the world and themselves are challenged forever in a conflict from which the world will never be the same.", "tmdb_score_value": 5.8, "tmdb_score_count": 304, "imdb_score_value": 5.9, "imdb_score_count": 19912, "meta_score_value": 38.0, "meta_score_count": 27}
