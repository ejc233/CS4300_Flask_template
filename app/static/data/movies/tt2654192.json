As he finishes two paintings, one that cost him his marriage, he feverishly works to create deep, three-dimensional 'pictures' layering real objects and shadows. When no one attends his NY show, he blames himself. With commentary from Dennis Hopper, we learn Llyn was kicked out of the Ferus Gallery for insulting another artist's work, setting the tone for the next fifty years of his refusal to sell out. Twenty years after performing on the Tonight Show, he plays 'The Machine' alone, a one-man band in both music and art. Part Clint Eastwood, part political anarchist, this intimate portrait of Llyn Foulkes follows his obsessive craft and process for eight years.", "tokens": ["at", "ag", "70", "la", "painter", "on", "man", "band", "musician", "llyn", "foulk", "struggl", "rememb", "as", "finish", "two", "paint", "on", "cost", "marriag", "feverishli", "work", "creat", "deep", "three", "dimension", "pictur", "layer", "real", "object", "shadow", "when", "on", "attend", "ny", "show", "blame", "with", "commentari", "denni", "hopper", "learn", "llyn", "kick", "feru", "galleri", "insult", "anoth", "artist", "work", "set", "tone", "next", "fifti", "year", "refus", "sell", "twenti", "year", "perform", "tonight", "show", "plai", "the", "machin", "alon", "on", "man", "band", "music", "art", "part", "clint", "eastwood", "part", "polit", "anarchist", "intim", "portrait", "llyn", "foulk", "follow", "obsess", "craft", "process", "eight", "year"], "tmdb_score_value": 8.5, "tmdb_score_count": 2, "imdb_score_value": 7.8, "imdb_score_count": 109, "meta_score_value": 63.0, "meta_score_count": 4}
