Just as her friend Charlotte must deal with her young daughter's \"terrible two's\", Carrie must deal with her relationship taking a turn for the worse - Big likes to watch old black-and-white movies on TV and eat take-out food, which prevents Carrie from feeling like the free-wheeling party girl she used to be. Meanwhile, Miranda copes with a new boss that can't handle an intelligent, powerful woman, and Samantha works a public relations angle that gets the fashionable foursome an all-expense-paid trip to Abu Dhabi.", "tmdb_score_value": 5.6, "tmdb_score_count": 555, "imdb_score_value": 4.4, "imdb_score_count": 65426, "meta_score_value": 27.0, "meta_score_count": 39}
