Women and Blacks have few rights. Jack Bull's dad is killed by Union soldiers, so the young men join the Bushwhackers, irregulars loyal to the South. One is a Black man, Daniel Holt, beholden to the man who bought his freedom. They skirmish then spend long hours hiding. Sue Lee, a young widow, brings them food. She and Jack Bull become lovers, and when he's grievously wounded, Jake escorts her south to a safe farm. The Bushwhackers, led by men set on revenge, make a raid into Kansas. At nineteen, Jake is ill at ease with war. As his friends die one after another, he must decide where honor lies.", "tokens": ["a", "littl", "known", "band", "civil", "war", "fighter", "known", "bushwhack", "us", "guerrilla", "warfar", "destroi", "yanke", "target"], "tmdb_score_value": 6.7, "tmdb_score_count": 60, "imdb_score_value": 6.8, "imdb_score_count": 11767, "meta_score_value": 69.0, "meta_score_count": 29}
