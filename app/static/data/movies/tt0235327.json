Marc Singer goes underground to live with them, and films this \"family.\" A dozen or so men and one woman talk about their lives: horrors of childhood, jail time, losing children, being coke-heads. They scavenge, they've built themselves sturdy one-room shacks; they have pets, cook, chat, argue, give each other haircuts. A bucket is their toilet. Leaky overhead pipes are a source of water for showers. They live in virtual darkness. During the filming, Amtrak gives a 30-day eviction notice.", "tokens": ["near", "penn", "station", "next", "amtrak", "track", "squatter", "live", "year", "marc", "singer", "goe", "underground", "live", "film", "famili", "a", "dozen", "men", "on", "woman", "talk", "live", "horror", "childhood", "jail", "time", "lose", "children", "coke", "head", "thei", "scaveng", "built", "sturdi", "on", "room", "shack", "pet", "cook", "chat", "argu", "give", "haircut", "a", "bucket", "toilet", "leaki", "overhead", "pipe", "sourc", "water", "shower", "thei", "live", "virtual", "dark", "dure", "film", "amtrak", "give", "30", "dai", "evict", "notic"], "tmdb_score_value": 7.6, "tmdb_score_count": 41, "imdb_score_value": 7.8, "imdb_score_count": 5880, "meta_score_value": 75.0, "meta_score_count": 25}
