To recapture his youth's artistic daring, Alfred decides his next film will adapt the lurid horror novel, Psycho (1960), over everyone's misgivings. Unfortunately, as Alfred self-finances and labors on this film, Alma finally loses patience with his roving eye and controlling habits with his actresses. When an ambitious friend lures her to collaborate on a work of their own, the resulting marital tension colors Alfred's work even as the novel's inspiration haunts his dreams.", "tmdb_score_value": 6.3, "tmdb_score_count": 645, "imdb_score_value": 6.8, "imdb_score_count": 65620, "meta_score_value": 55.0, "meta_score_count": 40}
