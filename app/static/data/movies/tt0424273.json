Maybe they have more in common than a love of the movies.", "tokens": ["for", "appar", "reason", "mute", "young", "woman", "assault", "youth", "deliv", "water", "bicycl", "injur", "ruin", "bike", "surprisingli", "ask", "feed", "fish", "custodi", "her", "tini", "apart", "discov", "shrine", "favorit", "escap", "movi", "he", "find", "diari", "screenplai", "life", "built", "around", "scene", "favorit", "film", "set", "imagin", "mayb", "common", "love", "movi"], "tmdb_score_value": 6.6, "tmdb_score_count": 8, "imdb_score_value": 7.6, "imdb_score_count": 928, "meta_score_value": 70.0, "meta_score_count": 7}
